0,1990 Andhra Pradesh cyclone,4 May,1990,the  andhra pradesh cyclone or the  machilipatnam cyclone was the worst disaster to affect southern india since the  andhra pradesh cyclone the system was first noted as a depression on  may  while it was located over the bay of bengal about  km  mi to the southeast of chennai india during the next day the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm and started to intensify rapidly becoming a super cyclonic storm early on  may the cyclone weakened slightly before it made landfall on india about  km  mi to the north of madras in the andhra pradesh state as a very severe cyclonic storm with winds of  kmh  mph while over land the cyclone gradually dissipated the cyclone had a severe impact on india with over  people reported to have been killed over  animals also died in the cyclone with the total cost of damages to crops estimated at over  million  usdon  may  the india meteorological department imd reported that a depression had developed over the bay of bengal about  km  mi to the southeast of chennai india during that day the system gradually developed further and became the subject of a tropical cyclone formation alert by the joint typhoon warning center as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure the depression subsequently intensified into a cyclonic storm early the next day before the jtwc initiated advisories on the system and designated it as tropical cyclone  later that day at this stage the jtwc only expected the cyclone to intensify marginally before it weakened as it made landfall in southern india within  hours during  may the system started to move more towards the northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge as it continued to intensify and became a very severe cyclonic storm this turn towards the northwest turned out to be more northerly than had been expected which as a result allowed the system to stay offshore for longer than had been expected by the jtwcover the next couple of days the system rapidly intensified before the jtwc reported early on  may that the system had peaked with  sustained windspeeds of  kmh  mph which made the system equivalent to a category  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale at around the same time the imd also reported that the cyclone had peaked as a super cyclonic storm with  sustained wind speeds of  kmh  mph and an estimated central pressure of  hpa  inhg by this time the system was located about  km  mi to the northeast of madras and was moving northwards slowly later that day as the ship visvamohini moved through the systems eye region it measured a central pressure of  hpa  inhg which the imd reported would be one of the lowest central pressures ever measured in the bay of bengal if it was correct the system subsequently started to weaken and had become a very severe cyclonic storm by the time it made landfall during  may near the mouth of the krishna river in southern andhra pradesh the system subsequently moved northwestwards and gradually weakened further before it was last noted during  may by both the imd and jtwcas a result of timely warnings issued by the imd the indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore this led to more than  people being evacuated to relief camps which had been set up on higher ground due to the thorough preparations there was fewer deaths than in the  andhra pradesh cycloneon edurumondi island over  people were left stranded after they refused to evacuate the island itself was reported to have experienced the full brunt of the system however all of the residents reportedly sought protection within a shelter provided by the government the cyclone had a significant effect on india with storm surge tides as high as  meters  ft above normal consequently over  villages were submerged in water and destroyed at least  people were killed by the cyclone most of the deaths occurred when houses made mostly out of mud and straw collapsed other people were killed when electrical wires were knocked down and while some people were carried away by flooded rivers the storm left at least  million people homeless while over  farm animals were killed at least  acres   of rice paddies were destroyed along with huge tracts of mango and banana trees the total damage to crops and property was estimated at over  million  usd the cyclone was described as the worst disaster in southern india since the  storm sea water contaminated fresh drinking wells prompting warnings about outbreaks of cholera and typhoid as many people were drinking and cooking with water from the drains which was causing stomach disordersoverall the cyclone only caused minor damage to tamil nadu with the worst affected area being the district of chengalpattu where one of the old shrines of kasiviswanathar temple collapsed as high waves hit the coast a large number of huts were also washed away by the waves while six deaths were reported in the stateon  may two days after the cyclone had hit the indian government launched a massive relief and rescue operation the indian army and naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone and also dropped food packets although the indian government did not request international assistance the red cross provided food oil medicines and water tanks for the affected families the wcccicarws issued an appeal for   usd so they could provide immediate needs with world vision providing   usd for food blankets and utensils,1990-05-04
1,Indian Airlines Flight 605,14 February,1990,indian airlines flight  was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from bombay to bangalore on  february  an airbus  registered as vtepn crashed onto a golf course while attempting to land at bangalore killing  of  people on boardthe indian investigative team ruled that the probable cause was the pilots selecting the open descentflight idle control mode rather than glideslope capture allowing the aircraft to sink far below the correct flight path they further failed to advance the throttles or pull up even after the radio altitude callouts as the aircraft approached landing the report stated that the crew of flight  weren’t aware of the situation and the danger they were facing at the time resulting in delayed reaction during the descentafter the crash the indian investigation committee issued  recommendations to the indian directorate general of civil aviation dgca including a time recording on the air traffic control atc tapes and the formation of several investigative committees specializing in several aviation operational issues included in the recommendation was the addition of a crash siren in bangalore evaluation of the evacuation doors and slides in airbus airplanes and a design change on their instrument knob the report also urged the government to evaluate every airport in india to prevent similar incidents from occurringthe crash drew criticism among the indian commercial pilot association icpa which claimed that the airbus  had severe flaws they claimed that the aircrafts systems were too confusing and that the crew of flight  was struggling to avert the crashanother  accident less than two years later which occurred under similar circumstances led to design improvements to the flight control unit and numerous safety recommendationsflight  took off from bombay airport at  local time after an hour delay prior to this the aircraft was used for two other flights on the day of the accident operating as flight  and flight  flying from bombay to goa and back the aircraft was an airbus  registered in india as vtepn first delivered to indian airlines on  december  carrying  passengers and  crew members including  infants the aircrafts assigned route was on route  from bombay to belgaum via karad and  from belgaum to bangalore the takeoff phase and en route phase proceeded normallyat  local time flight  radar plot appeared on bangalores radar flight  was asked by bangalore radar to turn right and make a visual approach to runway  the crew disengaged the autopilot and later changed to the bangalore tower after being transferred by bangalore radarwhile flight  was attempting to land the pilots flew far below the glideslope and the landing gear touched down on the grounds of the karnataka golf club approximately  ft from the airport most people on the aircraft including some crew members thought that the aircraft had touched down on the runway as it was similar to its normal landing flight  then bounced and shortly later impacted the ground for the second time the impact caused several peoples seat belts to fail leading people to be thrown from their seats and hit the aircrafts floor flight  later struck a  embankment both the engines and landing gear detached from the aircraft the aircraft then flew over a road and crashed into a grassy rocky area near the airportafter the crash a postimpact fire started and the survivors began to escape from the burning wreckage several people managed to get out of the plane from an opening in the aircrafts fuselage the surviving cabin crew opened the emergency door on the airplane and began to evacuate the survivors   people consisting of  passengers and  crew perished in the crash while  survived all with injuries two people succumbed to their injuries after the accidentaccording to eyewitnesses no fire service units reached the crash site as there was no radio transmitter rt communication facility between the tower and firefighting vehicles a portable radio transmitter was available for communication between the tower and the aerodrome fire station but was not serviceable on the day of the accidentflight  carried  passengers and  crew members consisting of  cockpit crew and  cabin crew there were  infants aboard the flightthe pilot who controlled the flight was indian national captain cyril fernandez at  years old he joined indian airlines in  as a pilot and was promoted to the position of copilot eventually he became captain of a hawker siddeley hs  in  fernandez obtained a boeing  copilot rating followed by a captain rating in  fernandez became the copilot of an airbus  in  fernandez had a total flying experience of  hours of which  hours were spent on the airbus  to the report captain fernandez was under supervision as he was undergoing the first of  route checks required for qualification to captain during the flight he was seated in the left seatthe pilot who supervised captain fernandez was indian national captain satish gopujkar at  years old he joined indian airlines in  and was employed as a copilot on a hawker siddeley hs  from – later flying the plane as a captain in  he obtained a boeing  copilot rating and later a pilot in command rating in  in  he was promoted as a copilot on an airbus  captain gopujkar had a total flying experience of  hours of which  hours were on the airbus  during the flight he was carrying out the duties of both the copilot and the check pilotbefore flight  captain gopujkar was involved in a taxiing incident in cochin although he was not blamed for the incident during flight  he was seated in the right  people were killed in the crash including captain gopujkar and captain fernandez according to official reports amongst the  injured people at least  had suffered head injuries  suffered lower limb injuries while  sustained thoracic injuries details in the report revealed that most of the dead suffered major trauma during the crash at least  victims were revealed to have suffered shock and burn injuriesthe report then stated that several passengers may have been too injured to move leaving them physically unable to escape from the burning wreckage they may have survived the impact but due to the injuries they suffered during the crash they couldnt escape the report stated that most people seated near the emergency exits and slides survived the crashas most survivors and victims of the crash suffered head and leg injuries the investigative team stated that those injuries might have occurred to the passengers and some of the crew onboard as a result of the inadequate leg room in addition during the crash several seats were thrust forward causing several passengers head to slam into the back of the seat in front of themthe indian ministry of civil aviation ordered a fullscale investigation into the crash the indian aaib and the canadian tsb were involved in the investigation on  february investigators visited the crash site and inspected the wreckage of the aircraft they noted that the front part of the aircraft was destroyed during its impact with the embankment a subsequent fire led to the total destruction of the aircraftinvestigators then inspected the flight controls of flight  viz the rudder the ailerons the trimmable horizontal stabilizer the flaps and slats and several other flight controls however they didnt find any abnormalities on these controls control failure was ruled out as a possible cause of the crash according to investigators they also ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash as there were no signs of an onboard explosion during the approach and there was no evidence of explosives on boardafter the discovery of the fdr and the cvr investigators decoded and analyzed its contentsinvestigators made an analysis based on both flight recorders as followsflight  was approaching bangalore airport in open descent mode in this mode the aircraft engines are at the idle throttle people would notice this since the engines seem to turn silent and the plane appears to be sinking graduallythe crew of flight  disengaged the autopilot when sighting the runway of bangalore airport they later made contact with bangalore tower at  pm local time the aircraft display indicated that the plane’s altitude had been just under  feet and its approach path was  ft higher than the normal glide pathcaptain fernandez noticed this and requested for a goaround he would climb to  ft do another circle and come back better aligned to the normal glide path the check pilot captain gopujkar then responded to his request do you want a go around or do you want vertical speed captain fernandez chose to proceed with the vertical speed option if the pilots had proceeded with the goaround the emergency that was to follow could have been avertedsince the plane was a little higher than the normal glide path captain fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of  ftmin instead of the normal rate of  ftmin this faster descent increased the aircraft speed to  kmhr — higher than the recommended speed of  kmhr — but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path the aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode — the correct mode for landingcaptain gopujkar then checked the landing checklist after completing the checklist he asked the cabin crew to be seated at their stations realizing that the aircraft had regained its normal glide path captain gopujkar reported at  that he had now selected a  ft rate of descent however instead of choosing the vertical speed knob he accidentally chose the altitude knob so instead of inputting an order for a  ft rate of descent to the airbus  he made an order to put the aircraft on an altitude of  ftthe vertical speed knob and the altitude knob are located next to each other and have a similar design this might have led to the confusionbecause of captain gopujkars action the aircraft went back to the open descent mode causing the throttle to be in the idle position the absence of engine power on the aircraft led to a decrease of the aircrafts speed and the plane began descending more quickly despite the impending disaster the crew of flight  seemed to be unaware of itthe planes radio altimeter then sounded  ft this probably alerted captain gopujkar in some way because he suddenly observed you are descending on idle open descend eh all this time and as the altimeter called out  ft captain gopujkar asked you want flight directors off now captain fernandez confirmed that his flight director had been put off captain gopujkars however hadnt if both the flight directors had been put off at that point the plane would have gone to the speed mode sensing that speed was dropping and enough engine power could have been generated for a possible recovery even at that late stagethe plane continued to hurtle downwards when the plane was only  ft from the ground captain fernandez suddenly realized the gravity of the situation and exclaimed hey were going down captain gopujkar himself stunned now could only respond with oh shit those were his last recorded words captain fernandez then ordered an immediate toga takeoff goaround however this action was too late the aircraft did lift from the ground however it failed to clear a  embankment and crashed investigators stated that if this action had been taken  seconds earlier the disaster could have been avertedthe high court of karnataka reported that the accident was caused by the pilots failing to realize the gravity of the situation and failing to respond by immediately advancing the throttles even after the radio altitude callouts of four hundred three hundred and two hundred feet despite knowing that the plane was in idleopen descent modeindias investigative team concluded that pilot error was the cause of the accident which was supported by airbus industrie however the india commercial pilot association icpa disputed the report claiming that a design flaw on the airbus  was the cause of the crashthe icpa stated that the senior captain of the flight captain gopujkar wouldnt have made the series of mistakes and stated that there was no proof that he made the faulty setting since the flight data recorder didnt record such mistakes the association also believes that the engines went into idle power because of a major system defect even when gopujkar tried to shut his director off it didnt respond they also claimed that the time lag of  seconds for the autothrust controls to act proved to be disastrousat the time the airbus  was relatively new having just been launched in  its main difference from other aircraft was that it used flybywire fbw technology in a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator so if the pilot opened the throttle more the actuator immediately gave the pilot more power in the  however the pilot’s command is first directed to an onboard computer — and the actuator responds only when the computer determines that it is okay to do sobefore the crash of flight  an airbus  had been involved in another crash air france flight  official investigations determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error however the pilot blamed the planes flybywire system for the crash this claim caused a major controversy about the airbus  than two years after the crash of flight  the  suffered another fatal accident when air inter flight  crashed in france killing  people the cause was also a cfit like  the investigation of flight  harshly criticized the airbus  cockpit design in response changes were made to the flight control unit panel display the french aviation safety authority issued  recommendations,1990-02-14

10,1994 Gowari stampede,23 November,1994,the  gowari stampede occurred at nagpur india on  november  in which  people from the gowari community were killed and  more injured nagpur police were trying to disperse almost  gowari protesters using a baton charge but it created panic and triggered a stampede amongst the protesters gowaris are an ethnic group of central india and are predominantly present in nagpur the majority of casualties were women and children who were crushed to death under the crowd’s feet as they scrambled to escape the police line some were victims of barbed wire piercing as they were climbing over high fences to escape the maharashtra state government appointed the oneman justice s s dani commission to investigate the event but it held nobody responsible and referred to the tragedy as an unfortunate one the commission justified the police action of batoncharge to control such a huge crowd the commission also cleared state chief minister sharad pawar and the rest of the government for any responsibility in the incident maharashtra’s tribal development minister madhukar pichad later resigned accepting moral responsibility for the tragedyevery year the winter session of maharashtra state assembly vidhan sabha is held at vidhan bhavan nagpur for quite some time the gowari community had been demanding scheduled tribe status to avail themselves of the benefits of reservations in government jobs and education on  november  gowari protesters led by gowari sanghatana were trying to reach vidhan bhavan and present their demands to the state government nagpur police had earlier banned all protest marches during the winter session of the assembly nagpur police stopped the march of  protesters at nagpur’s vasantrao naik college of arts and social sciences morris college however no government official turned up to talk with protesters and resentment grew disturbances started amongst the crowd as they tried to break the police barricades police gave out repeated warnings to maintain order but the situation was getting out of control chief minister sharad pawar had already flown back to mumbai after concluding the day’s session at  pm a car with a red light atop it arrived and protesters at the front rushed towards it they assumed some minister had arrived to take up their petition however police feared trouble and started wielding batons to push back the protesters this initially caused them to retreat but word of the police attack spread causing a panic with protesters trying to run awaywomen along with children who were part of the protest march got caught in the midst of the chaos they were trampled and asphyxiated under the feet of running protesters in all  people lost their lives in the tragedy autopsies conducted on the victims concluded that their deaths were caused by traumatic asphyxia they were the result of chest compression and obstruction of the respiratory systemsoon after the tragedy the maharashtra government appointed a oneman commission  justice s s dani  to investigate the causes of the tragedy meanwhile the opposition bhartiya janata partyshiv sena coalition took immediate political advantage of this tragedy and it became one of the factors for the indian national congress losing the state elections of  after many extensions the dani commission finally tabled its report in march  and found nobody responsible it noted that pawar was neither aware of the protest taking place outside of vidhan bhawan nor the nature of the protesters demands pawar who was now leader of the opposition in the lok sabha had initially stated that he feared state government was trying to frame him by altering the commission’s report the commission concluded that the police were right to initiate a baton charge on the surging crowd in order to maintain order while the assembly session was going on it also noted that almost all deaths were caused due to people getting trampled under the feet of the stampeding crowd and suffering asphyxia and not due to injuries caused by the baton charge however the commission suggested that water sprayers and rubber bullets be used first and that police should carry out baton charges only as a last resort after giving two warnings the commission based its report on statements given by local press and photographers along with independent witnesses at the site the bjpss led government quickly rejected the report chief minister manohar joshi was quoted as saying any one of them going and talking to the protesters could have averted the tragedyafter coming to power the bhartiya janata partyshiv senaled government had announced a special backward caste sbc category for  such communities with  percent reservations in education and government jobs however the supreme court of india ruling that reservation quotas cannot exceed  percent has created legal problems for sbc quotas political efforts to assimilate  percent sbc under already existing scheduled tribe or other backward caste obc quotas have faced tough opposition from their respective legislators lobby after losing the  maharashtra state assembly elections the bjp seems to have lost interest in gowari incident the gowari issue surfaced periodically during assembly sessions the nagpur bench of bombay high court on  august  ruled that gowari community in maharashtra should get benefits under the scheduled tribes st category pointing out that gowaris were categorised as a tribe more than hundred years ago in the records of british indiaa monument has been built in central nagpur to commemorate those who died in this tragedy also the flyover in sitabuldi has been named aadivasi gowari shahid flyover,1994-11-23

16,Uphaar Cinema fire,"Sunday, 13 June",1997,the uphaar cinema fire was one of the worst fire tragedies in recent indian history the fire started on friday  june  at uphaar cinema in green park delhi during the three oclock screening of the movie border fiftynine people were trapped inside and died of asphyxiation while  were seriously injured in the resulting stampede suffocationthe victims and the families of the deceased later formed the association of victims of uphaar fire tragedy avut which filed the landmark civil compensation case it won ₹ crore equivalent to ₹ crore or  million in  in compensation for the families of the victims the case  is now considered a breakthrough in civil compensation law in india however on  october  the supreme court nearly halved the sum of compensation awarded to victims by the  and slashed punitive damages to be paid by cinema owners the ansal brothers from ₹ crore equivalent to ₹ crore or  in  to ₹ lakh equivalent to ₹ lakh or  in  its final order on august   the supreme court modified its earlier order and sentenced the ansal brothers to a twoyear jail term if they failed to pay the families of the victims  crore each within three months the supreme court reviewed this order again on february   and sentenced gopal ansal to a year in jail for the case the other accused sushil ansal did not have to serve a further more sentence because of his old ageon june   at about  am the bigger of the two transformers installed and maintained by dvb on the ground floor of the uphaar cinema building caught fire at around  am an explosion was heard by the security guard sudhir kumar who then discovered smoke in the transformer room the fire brigade and the delhi vidyut board dvb were informed and the fire was brought under control by  am inspection of the transformer by the superintendent of the dvb and his team revealed that three of the low tension cable leads of the transformer had been partially burnt at around  am inspectors from dvb and senior fitter conducted repairs on the transformer by replacing two aluminum sockets on the bphase of the low tension cable leads the repairs it appears were carried out with the help of a die and hammer and without the use of a crimping machine dvb completed their repairs between  am and  am  the transformer was recharged for the resumption of electric supply by  am on june   is alleged that repairs conducted on the transformer in the earlier part of the day were unsatisfactory and resulted in loose connections that caused sparking on the bphase of the transformers this resulted in the loosening of one of the cables of the transformer which eventually came off and started dangling loose along with the radiator and burnt a hole in the radiator fin through this hole the transformer oil started leaking out which on account of the heat generated by the loose cable touching against the radiator ignited the oil at about  pm on  june  since the transformer did not have an oil soak pit as required under the regulations and the standard practice the oil that spread out of the enclosure continued leaking and spreading the fire to the adjacent parking lot where cars were parked at a distance of no more than a metre from the door of the transformer the result was that all the cars parked in the parking area on the ground floor of the cinema hall were ablaze smoke started billowing in the northern and southward directions in the parking lot of the cinema complex the northern bound smoke encountered a gate which was adjacent to a staircase leading to the cinema auditorium on the first floor due to chimney effect the smoke gushed into the stairwell and eventually entered the cinema auditorium through a door and through the air conditioning ducts the southward bound smoke similarly traveled aerially through another staircase and into the lower portion of the balcony of the auditorium from the left side all this happened while numerous of people were seated in the auditorium enjoying the matinee show of ‘border’ a popular hindi movie with a patriotic themebecause of smoke and carbon monoxide released by the burning oil and other combustible material the people in the auditorium started suffocating the shift incharge of the green park complaint centre of dvb received a telephonic message at the relevant point of time regarding the fire it was only then that the aiims grid to which the transformer in question was connected was switched off and the flow of energy to the cinema complex stopped according to the prosecution the supply of the  kv outgoing green park feeder tripped off at  pm thereby discontinuing the supply of energy to the cinema inside the auditorium and balcony there was complete pandemonium the people in the balcony are said to have rushed towards the exits in pitch darkness as there were neither emergency lights nor any cinema staff to help or guide them no public announcement regarding the fire was made to those inside the auditorium or the balcony nor were any fire alarms set off no matter the management and the employees of the uphaar cinema were aware of the fact that a fire had broken out even the projector operator was not given instructions to stop the film while the fire was raging nor was any patron informed about the situation outside on the contrary doors to the middle entrance of the balcony were found to be bolted by the gatekeeper who had left his duty without handing over charge to his reliever more importantly the addition of a private  box had completely closed off the exit on the right side of the balcony while the addition of a total of  extra seats over the years had completely blocked the gangway on the right side of the balcony similarly the gangway on the right of the middle entrance was significantly narrower than required under the regulations all these obstructions deviations violations and deficiencies had resulted in the victims getting trapped in the balcony for at least – minutes exposing them to lethal carbon monoxide to which as many as  persons eventually succumbedan offduty capt manjinder singh bhinder of the  cavalry of the indian army and a

22,2001 Gujarat earthquake,26 January,2001,the  gujarat earthquake also known as the bhuj earthquake occurred on  january indias  republic day at mwparseroutput   am ist the epicentre was about  km southsouthwest of the village of chobari in bhachau taluka of kutch district of gujarat indiathe intraplate earthquake reached  on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum felt intensity of x extreme on the mercalli intensity scale the earthquake killed between  and  people including  in southeastern pakistan injured another  and destroyed nearly  buildingsgujarat lies – km from the plate boundary between the indian plate and the eurasian plate but the current tectonics are still governed by the effects of the continuing continental collision along this boundary during the breakup of gondwana in the jurassic this area was affected by rifting with a roughly west–east trend during the collision with eurasia the area has undergone shortening involving both reactivation of the original rift faults and development of new lowangle thrust faults the related folding has formed a series of ranges particularly in central kutchthe focal mechanism of most earthquakes is consistent with reverse faulting on reactivated rift faults the pattern of uplift and subsidence associated with the  rann of kutch earthquake is consistent with reactivation of such a faultthe  gujarat earthquake was caused by movement on a previously unknown southdipping fault trending parallel to the inferred rift structuresthe death toll in the kutch region was  bhuj which was situated only  km away from the epicentre was devastated considerable damage also occurred in bhachau and anjar with hundreds of villages flattened in taluka of anjar bhuj and bhachau over one million structures were damaged or destroyed including many historic buildings and tourist attractions the quake destroyed around  of homes eight schools two hospitals and  km of road in bhuj and partly destroyed the citys

supplies and around  houses  of the districts housing stock the biggest setback was the total demolition of the bhuj civil hospital the indian military provided emergency support which was later augmented by the international federation of red cross and red crescent society a temporary red cross hospital remained in bhuj to provide care while a replacement hospital was builtfour months after the earthquake the gujarat government announced the gujarat earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation policy the policy proposed a different approach to urban and rural construction with the estimated cost of rebuilding to be  billionthe main objectives of the policy included repairing building and strengthening houses and public buildings other objectives included the revival of the economy health support and reconstruction of the community and social infrastructurethe housing policies focused on the removal of rubble setting up temporary shelters full reconstruction of damaged houses and the retrofitting of undamaged units the policy established a communitydriven housing recovery process the communities affected by the earthquake were given the option for complete or partial relocation to insitu reconstruction the total number of eligible houses to be repaired was  and the total number of eligible houses to be reconstructed was  by    houses were repaired and   were reconstructedthe environmental planning collaborative epc was commissioned to provide a new city plan for the city of bhuj the plan focused on creating a wider roadway network to provide emergency access to the city the epc used land readjustment lr in the form of eight town planning schemes this was implemented by deducting land from private lot sizes to create adequate public land for the widening of roadways the remaining land was readjusted and given back to the original owners as final plotsin order to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the city the government of gujarat created four assistance packages worth up to  billion these packages assisted about  families the government also announced a  million package to revive small medium and cottage industries the world bank and the asian development bank also provided loans worth  million and  million respectivelyassistance was offered from many countries and organisations  vietnam saudi arabiasmritivan a

23,2001 Gujarat cyclone,May 27,2001,the  gujarat cyclone was the third strongest tropical cyclone in terms of barometric pressure to form in the arabian sea on record only cyclones gonu in  and kyarr in  were stronger the storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of somalia on may  over the following few days the system gradually organized into a tropical depression tracking eastward towards the coastline of southwestern india the storm slowly intensified shortly before reaching shore the system turned north and later west away from land after taking this turn the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm attaining its peak intensity on may  with winds of  kmh  mph  winds and a barometric pressure of  mbar hpa at the time this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the arabian seaafter stalling several hundred kilometres offshore the storm weakened over cooler waters that it had upwelled by may  the system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by this time was approaching the northwestern coastline of india near gujarat the following day the storm made landfall in the saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of  kmh  mph  winds the depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on may  a powerful cyclone over water the storm had relatively little impact over land in the valsad district two coastal communities lost a combined  homes due to large swells produced by the storm however the losses were more extensive offshore between  and  fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the stormthe origins of the  gujarat cyclone can be traced to a tropical disturbance over the arabian sea on may  the following day the system was determined to be relatively stationary near the island of socotra although deep convection was associated with the disturbance there was no evidence of a lowlevel circulation by may  the disturbance slowly moved towards the southeast in response to an upperlevel trough over india the overall structure gradually improved as good outflow developed a midlevel circulation finally developed late on may  prompting the joint typhoon warning center jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert several hours later they began monitoring the system as a tropical depression with the identifier  however operational advisories were not issued until the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity by the morning of may  the india meteorological department imd also took notice of the systemsituated in a region favoring tropical cyclone development about  km  mi southwest of mumbai india the storm rapidly developed by the afternoon of may  the jtwc estimated that  attained winds of  kmh  mph equivalent to a category  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale additionally a  km  miwide eye developed within the center of circulation during this intensification phase throughout most of may  the strengthening slowed considerably as it paralleled the southwestern coast of india initially it was feared that the storm would move inland as a powerful cyclone however a ridge over the northern arabian sea caused the storm to turn westward back over open water once further away from land the cyclone resumed intensification becoming a rare category  equivalent storm by the morning of may  later that morning  attained its peak intensity with winds of  kmh  mph according to the jtwc however the imd considered the storm to be slightly stronger estimating that it attained winds of  kmh  mph by threeminute sustained winds along with a barometric pressure of  mbar hpa  inhgat the time of peak intensity the cyclone displayed a welldefined eye and excellent outflow although a powerful storm it quickly weakened as conditions became hostile for tropical cyclone development strong wind shear tore convection away from the cyclone and caused it to become disorganized within  hours the system had degraded to a tropical storm and was situated roughly  km  mi westsouthwest of mumbai the weakening trend lessened shortly thereafter but still continued operationally the jtwc issued their final advisory on the cyclone on may  as it weakened to a tropical depression over open waters the once powerful cyclone now devoid of all convection tracked towards the northwestern coast of india during the afternoon of may  the cyclone rapidly regenerated as it made landfall in gujarat the jtwc estimated that it crossed the coastline with winds of  kmh  mph not long after moving overland the system rapidly weakened and dissipated over india within several hoursahead of the storm all ports in gujarat including kandla one of the largest in the country were closed as a precautionary measure on may  over  people were evacuated from coastal areas in the threatened region throughout india a total of  people were evacuated and  more were evacuated in pakistan the indian military was placed on standby to undertake searchandrescue missions immediately after the storms passage fourteen districts of gujarat were placed on red alert the highest level of preparedness seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching stormseveral relief agencies were already positioned in the region in response to a magnitude  earthquake in january of that year that killed over  people additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone food water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of the storm large swells produced by the storm affected a large portion of the western indian coastline especially in the city of bombay in the valsad district two coastal communities lost a combined  homes due to large swells produced by the storm offshore between  and  fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland later reports indicated that between  and  fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cycloneoperationally the cyclone was considered to be a category  equivalent storm by the jtwc with peak winds of  kmh  mph this would have made the system the first recorded storm of that intensity on record in the arabian sea however in poststorm analysis it was discovered that  winds did not exceed  kmh  mph the next storm to reach this intensity was cyclone gonu in  north indian ocean cyclone season which became the first known super cyclonic storm in the region upon attaining its peak intensity the storm attained a barometric pressure of  mbar hpa the lowest in the region at the time the cyclone was ranked as the strongest in the arabian sea for six years until it was surpassed by gonu in  which attained a minimum pressure of  mbar hpa in  cyclone phet surpassed the  cyclone as the secondstrongest storm in the region attaining winds of  kmh  mph according to the jtwc again it was surpassed to sixth place as cyclone kyarr cyclone chapala cyclone tauktae and cyclone nilofar surpassed its windspeed intensity as they become category  tropical cyclones in later years now this cyclone is tied with cyclone megh for sixth strongest cyclone in arabian sea based on windspeed of one minute mean,2001-05-27
24,2002 West Bengal cyclone,November 12,2002,the  west bengal cyclone jtwc designation  officially known as severe cyclonic storm bob  was a deadly tropical cyclone that affected india and bangladesh in november  the sixth tropical cyclone and fourth cyclonic storm of the  north indian ocean cyclone season it developed in the bay of bengal northeast of sri lanka on november  as a tropical depression after tracking northeast the system strengthened into a cyclonic storm on november  as maximum sustained winds exceeded  kmh  mph on november  it further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm later that day the storm made landfall on sagar island in west bengal with winds of  kmh  mph after moving inland it rapidly weakened and dissipated over bangladesh on november  seas offshore odisha caused two fishing trawlers to collide resulting in  fatalities while two additional trawlers were reported missing in west bengal the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall throughout india  deaths were confirmed strong winds and heavy rainfall in bangladesh impacted many cities and villages including the capital city of dhaka forcing thousands to evacuate ten wooden trawlers carrying  men sank offshore bangladesh with only  reaching safety eight additional boats with  occupants were reported missing one death was reported in bangladesh after a man attempted to cross a swollen river overall there were  fatalities in bangladesh the storm was attributed to at least  fatalities in india bangladesh and offshore areasaround  utc on november  a depression developed in the southwestern bay of bengal three hours later a bulletin from the india meteorological department imd indicated that bob  formed about  km  mi eastsoutheast of chennai india the system steadily intensified and headed northeastward at  utc on november  the depression reached gale force and was upgraded to cyclonic storm bob  at that time the joint typhoon warning center jtwc initiated warnings on tropical cyclone  further strengthening briefly slowed later on november  however early on the following day the storm resumed intensificationat  utc on november  bob  became a severe cyclonic storm and reached its maximum sustained wind speed of  kmh  mph in addition to an estimated minimum barometric pressure of  mbar  inhg however the regional meteorological centre rmc in kolkata india bulletin at  utc on november  reported maximum sustained winds of only – kmh – mph at  utc on november  it made landfall near sagar island west bengal with winds of  kmh  mph shortly after moving inland the storm rapidly weakened to a depression the jtwc issued their final advisory on the storm at  utc on november  while it was centered about  km  mi northeast of kolkata however the imd tracked the cyclone until about six hours later at which time it dissipated over eastern indiaas the storm approached residents of lowlying areas were advised to seek shelter according to the odisha state disaster management authority the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones additionally district authorities collected food water and other essential emergency supplies offshore odisha rough seas caused two trawlers to collide resulting in  fatalities their bodies were later found floating dhamra port in the bhadrak district of odisha two additional trawlers were reported missing nine fishing trawlers sank offshore west bengal with only  fishermen accounted for initially as many as  were estimated to have been missing though  people swam back to digha where most of them received treatment at either a medical clinic or a hospital according to the chief minister of west bengal  people were still missing offshore west bengal by late on november  fortynine fatalities were confirmed offshore india while two deaths occurred inland in west bengal later the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters raised the death toll to  minister of bangladesh khaleda zia urged senior officials in dhaka and coastal districts to prepare for the storm officials in chittagong asked that all  ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel in coastal areas thousands of red crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm winds destroyed bamboo huts uprooted trees and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the bay of bengal torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages forcing thousands to evacuate heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of dhaka inundating streets which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation one death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern bhola island ten wooden trawlers carrying  men sank near coxs bazar only  of them were known to have survived an additional eight fishing boats transporting  people was reported missing off of barisal division by november   fishing vessels were still unaccounted for a navy motor boat also sunk near kutubdia though its six crew members swam ashore in the aftermath of the storm the number of deaths in bangladesh rose to  the storm resulted in  confirmed fatalities officials in west bengal accused the meteorological offices of issuing warnings too late as most of the fishermen were already in deep sea areas immediately following the storm the indian red cross society and the participating national societies began to assess the

metropolitan region was struck by a severe storm and subsequent deluge the indian meteorological department imd station in santacruz recorded  mmlocal train movement came to a halt by  pm due to the waterlogging on the tracks this caused traffic on roads to increase dramatically with water logging and submerging of certain lowlying pockets of the region such as dharavi and bandrakurla complexthousands of school children were stranded due to flooding and could not reach home for up to  hours the following two days were declared as school and college holidays by the state governmentthe rain water caused the sewage system to overflow and all water lines were contaminated the government ordered all housing societies to add chlorine to their water tanksthe financial cost of floods was unprecedented and these floods caused a stoppage of entire commercial trading and industrial activity for days preliminary indications indicate that the floods caused a direct loss of about ₹ billion € million or  million the financial impact of the floods were manifested in a variety of waysthe present stormwater drainage system in mumbai was put in place in the early  century and is capable of carrying only  millimetres of water per hour which was extremely inadequate on a day when  mm of rain fell in the city  the drainage system was also clogged at several placesonly  outfalls ways out to the sea are equipped with floodgates whereas the remaining  open directly into the sea for more than  hours as a result there is no way to stop the seawater from rushing into the drainage system during high tidein  an ambitious plan was drawn to overhaul the citys storm water drainage system which had never been reviewed in over  years a project costing approximately  billion rupees was proposed by uk based consultants hired by the brihanmumbai municipal corporation to study the matter implementation of the project would have ensured that rainwater did not flood the streets of mumbai the project was planned to have completed by  and aimed to enhance the drainage system through larger diameter storm water drains and pipes using pumps wherever necessary and removing encroachments the project if implemented would have doubled the storm water carrying capacity to  mm per hourthe bmc committee had rejected the proposed project on the grounds that it was too costly these were few of the drawbacks due to which the city suffered so gravelydevelopment in certain parts of mumbai is haphazard and buildings are constructed without proper planning the drainage plans in northern suburbs is chalked out as and when required in a particular area and not from an overall point of viewthe environment ministry of the government of india was informed in the early  that sanctioning the bandrakurla complex a commercial complex in northern mumbai was leading to disaster no environment clearance is mandatory for large urban construction projects in northern mumbai officials in the environment ministry claimed that it was not practical to impose new guidelines with retrospective effect as there are millions of buildingsmangrove ecosystems which exist along the mithi river and mahim creek are being destroyed and replaced with construction hundreds of acres of swamps in mahim creek have been reclaimed and put to use for construction by builders these ecosystems serve as a buffer between land and sea it is estimated that mumbai has lost about  of its mangroves between  and  some to builders and some to encroachment slums sewage and garbage dumps have also destroyed mangroves the bandrakurla complex in particular was created by replacing such swamps the most acclaimed mindspace cbd inorbit mall in goregaon  malad has been built by destroying a

more to this sum to claim the central assistance one can well imagine the gap that exists between the available small funds to the tune of rs  crores against a demand of rs  crores some money may be available through the channels of national calamity contingencies fund nccf but that too is drop in the ocean the rest will have to be borne by the state government or by the affected family itself

42,2008 Bihar flood,18 August,2008,the  bihar flood was one of the most disastrous floods in the history of bihar an impoverished and densely populated state in india the koshi embankment near the indonepal border at kusaha vdc sunsari district nepal broke on  august   the river changed course and flooded areas which had not been flooded in many decades the flood affected over  million people in the northern part of biharon  august  heavy monsoon rains and poor maintenance caused a breach in the kosi embankment water passed through the breach at an estimated  cubic meters per second  cusecs flooding many villages in nepal and hundreds of villages in northern bihar  the flood submerged most of the kosi alluvial fan area which is very fertile with a dense agrarian populationthe kosi rivers upper basin in southern tibet and eastern nepal drains some   of mountainous terrain a region that tectonic forces are elevating by about  cm a year if erosion keeps pace with geologic uplift an estimated  million cubic meters of sediment would be carried downstream in an average year however empirical measurements of the rivers sediment load have yielded estimates of  million cubic meters annually indicating that the area is risingriver gradient ranges from more than  meterskm for major upper tributaries in the mountains to as little as  cmkm as the lower kosi nears the ganges as the gradient decreases on the plains current slows and turbulence that holds sediments in suspension diminishes  sediments settle out and are deposited on the riverbed this process eventually raises a channel above the surrounding terrain the river breaks out seeking lower terrain which it again proceeds to elevate by deposition this creates a coneshaped alluvial fan the kosi alluvial fan is one of the largest in the world covering some   and extending  km from the outermost foothills of the himalayas to the ganges river valleyflood waters naturally spread out over the surface of this cone flows over  m³s have been measured where the kosi exits the himalayan foothills enough to create a flow of water  km wide at this rate in one week enough water would accumulate to cover the entire megafan to a depth of  meterspreventative flood control measures include upstream reservoirs that can also serve irrigation needs and produce hydroelectric power however in nepal these are mostly in the planning stages the flood control measures mainly consist of downstream embankments meant to confine the river to a fixed channel in theory the faster flow along this channel would carry high flows away and keep sediments in suspension on  august  one of the manmade embankments failed  the river reverted from the prescribed western channel to an old channel near the centre of its alluvial fan the river spread out widely and flooded towns villages and cultivated fields on the densely populated alluvial fan recurrent flooding on the lower kosi contributes largely to indias history of suffering more flood deaths than any other country except bangladesh and has earned the kosi the epithet the sorrow of biharflooding occurred throughout the kosi river valley in northern bihar in the

their own house after signing an agreement with the world bank in january  this programme has been upscaled to cover  families for reconstruction of hazard safe houses the cost per house will be rs   with an additional cost of rs   for a toilet and rs   for solar powered lighting in cases where beneficiaries do not own land the government of bihar will provide additional assistance of rs   for the people to buy the land towards this project the world bank is contributing  million the government of bihar has also partnered with odr collaborative and undp to continue the social and technical facilitation and capacity building for this owner driven reconstruction programme technical guidelines have been brought out to enable owners to build houses with various local materials including bamboothe rehabilitation work has been incredibly slow out of a total  houses to be built by the government in the kosi region comprising madhepura saharsa and supaul districts only  were built till february  messages sent by engineers at the kosi dam warning the state government of the impending disaster went unheeded as the official authorised to respond was on leave consequently many residents waiting for evacuation instructions never received warning of the flood nitish mishra bihars disaster management minister said there should definitely be some accountability and that action would be takenbihar government appointed a oneman inquiry commission headed by justice rajesh walia former chief justice of patna high court to probe the cause of the embankment breach it was asked to examine all aspects related to the efforts to maintain the utility of the kosi project since its inception in  – particularly after a major landslide in  pushed the kosi towards its eastern bund – and a

43,2008 Indian floods,June to September.,2008,the  indian floods were a series of floods in various states of india during the  monsoon season the floods mostly affected the western regions of maharashtra state and andhra pradesh as well as northern bihar in india the monsoon season generally lasts from june to septemberaccording to ministry of home affairs indias disaster management unit the countrywide death toll from floods in various states was  between june to septemberearlier during the start of the monsoon season west bengal and orissa were hit with heavy rains creating a floodlike situation in the two states the monsoon killed  people mostly in the countrys east and northeast in andhra pradesh alone  people died in a matter of two days because of sudden heavy rainsin august the konkan region of maharashtra experienced heavy monsoon rains placing lives in jeopardy many intercity trains between mumbai and pune were cancelled heavy waterlogging had been reported from chiplun rajapur khed and mahad in maharashtra on  august  a major landslide caused extensive damage to a threestory building at the sinhgad technical education societys stes academic campus in lonavla a large number of passengers were reportedly stranded at various railway stations across western maharashtra as central railways canceled many trains vehicular traffic on the mumbaipune expressway was also affected due to heavy rainfall and was divertedin mumbai heavy rains lashed the city and its suburbs affecting traffic and disrupting rail services on the days of – augustin andhra pradesh  relief camps were set up in the state most of them in the guntur and krishna districts hyderabad krishna district and the east and west godavari districts were the worst affected areas due to floods the situation in andhra pradesh was more deadly as  people reportedly died due to floods in hyderabad alone  people were killed when they were crushed by the collapsing roofs of their homesthe nexus of the bihar flood is the kosi rivers immense alluvial fan extending some  km from the rivers exit from the himalayas and foothills in nepal down to its confluence with the ganges in bihar the laws of geology and physics cause rivers to course back and forth across such fans in ephemeral channels lasting decades at most but for flood control reasons manmade embankments endeavored to contain the koshi within a channel along its fans western edge  on  august heavy monsoon rains caused the river to break out of this channel  it started flowing through an old channel much further east inundating cropland and towns and villages with  million inhabitants mostly in biharchief minister of bihar nitish kumar met india prime minister manmohan singh to seek his help in dealing with the catastrophe the worst affected districts included supaul madhepura north bhagalpur araria purnia all by the kosi and west champaran by gandak relief work was carried with indian air force helicopters dropping relief materials in the worst hit districtsthe district magistrate of madhepura has ordered the inhabitants of the town of madhepura to evacuate because the water level continued to rise relief work was carried with indian air force helicopters dropping relief materials including  food packets per day from purnia in the worst hit districts where nearly two million persons were entrappedit is not possible to assess the magnitude of deaths or destruction because the affected areas are totally inaccessible even mobile phones had stopped working because entrapped persons cannot get their batteries charged  persons were washed away in a single incident dainik hindustan darbhanga edition another report says  people have died in the flood in biharthe government of bihar has constituted a technical committee headed by retired engineerinchief of the water resource department nilendu sanyal to manage the restoration work and closure of the breach in the east koshi afflux embankment indian authorities were working to prevent further widening of the breach and channels would be dug to direct the water back to the main river bed however dainik hindustan darbhanga edition reported on aug  that indian officials were chased away by antisocial elements from the breach site in nepal nepals defence minister has made a statement that nepal will repair the breach on its own although it was not made clear when this work will be starteddainik hindustan darbhanga edition later sent its reporter to the site of the kushaha breach who reported with photographs on sep  that all earlier claims by government officials of repairing the breach and of nepalis chasing away indian officials were utterly false reports by indian officials because there were thick forests on the embankment and it was not possible to reach the site before the end of august forest on the embankment proves that these parts of kosi embankments were not even visited for decades its maintenance was the responsibility of indian especially bihars officials the life of these embankments elapsed over two decades ago but no effort was taken to even survey their conditions although the bihar government spends huge sums on the maintenance of embankments each yeara highlevel government of nepal team that inspected areas devastated by the flood in the koshi river has held india responsible for the havoc media reports stated the devastation took place as the indian side did not carry out repair and maintenance work on the kosi barrage and the embankment along the river thereby violating the nepalindia koshi agreement as per the bilateral agreement of  india is entirely responsible for repair and maintenance work and operation of the barrage there was no effort by indian officials to repair the breach in time although the kosi took  days to make the breachon the other hand indian engineers say that antisocial elements in nepal did not allow them to repair the embankment dainik hindustan darbhanga edition aug  these socalled antisocial elements are the victims of the kosi embankments who have been forced to bear tsunamilike floods every year they are happy that the river wants to change its course kosi embankments are designed to contain the kosi in the channel of the tilyuga river while the old course of the kosi lies far to the east in purnia district later dainik hindustan reported on sep  that indian officials could not reach the site of breach as there were forests on the embankment which were cleared in early september hence indian officials were lying about being prevented to repair the breach they had not visited the site for decades due to forests in the waythe new york times reported that it is the worst flood in the area in  years prompting manmohan singh to declare a “national calamity” on  august the government earmarked  million in aid for the region the indian army national disaster response force ndrf and nongovernmental organizations operated the biggest flood rescue operation in india in more than  years death tolls rose from indian floods as more than  people had been killed in monsoon rains villagers ate raw rice

toxicologist carin smit visiting faridkot city in punjab india instrumental in having hair and urine samples taken  of  children respectively who were affected with birth abnormalities including physical deformities neurological and mental disorders these samples were shipped to microtrace mineral lab germanyat the onset of the action research project it was expected that heavy metal toxicity might be implicated as reasons why these children were so badly affected  surprisingly high levels of uranium were found in  of the samples and in the case of one child the levels were more than  times the maximum safe limita study carried out amongst mentally retarded children in the malwa region of punjab revealed  of children below  years and  beyond that age having uranium levels high enough to cause diseases also uranium levels in samples of three kids from kotkapura and faridkot were   and  times higher than normalsubsequently the baba farid centre for special children faridkot sent samples of five children from the worstaffected village teja rohela near fazilka which has over  children which are congenitally mentally and physically challenged to the same labsince  micro trace minerals of germany has continued testing cancer patients living in the malwa region of punjab the area known for having the highest cancer rate in india patient evaluation and the collection of nail samples was carried out with the help of prof chander parkash of the technical university of punjab as with previous studies high uranium was found in nearly all test persons the work was published in the british journal of medicine and medical research in  early as  guru nanak dev university gndu released a report showing the presence of uranium and other heavy metals beyond permissible limits in water samples collected from bathinda and amritsar district however there was no response from the government at that time the hotspot for this increased toxicity however was the malwa region of punjab which showed extremely high levels of chemical biological and radioactive toxicity including uranium contamination as the regions groundwater and food chain was gradually contaminated by industrial effluents flowing into fresh water sources used both for irrigation and drinking purposes the region showed a rise in neurological diseases and a sharp increase in cancer cases and kidney ailments for example in muktsar district between  and   people died of cancerover the years a case of slow poisoning was suspected by health workers of the baba farid center for special children bfcsc in bathinda and faridkot when they saw a sharp increase in the number of severely handicapped children birth defects like hydrocephaly microcephaly cerebral palsy downs syndrome and other physical and mental abnormalities and cancers in childrenin march  dr carin smit a candidate clinical metal toxicologist in private practice in south africa and vera dirr a teacher of children with cerebral palsy alarmed after seen a high incidences of abnormalities in local children at the baba farid center for special children bfcsc in faridkot a notforprofit organization working with kids ailing from autism cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders requested help for laboratory tests from microtarce mineral lab germany the centre reported a rise in the number of cases in the last six to seven years the bfcsc uses naturopathic principles to treat is patientssubsequent tests carried out on the ground water displayed levels of uranium as high as  micrograms per litre µgl  however samples taken in the vicinity of the around the coalfired power plants were up to  times above the world health organizations maximum safe limits  it was found that the contamination included a large parts of the state of punjab home to  million people in  water samples taken from buddha nullah a highly polluted water canal which merges into the sutlej river showed heavy metal content as quite high and the presence of uranium  times the reference range and together with other forms of pollution like ammonia phosphate chloride chromium arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticides the rivulet is now being termed as other bhopal in the makingan investigation carried out the observer newspaper in  revealed the possible that cause of contamination of soil and ground water in malwa region of punjab to be the fly ash from coal burnt at thermal power plants which contains high levels of uranium and ash as the region has states two biggest coalfired power stationstests on ground water carried out by dr chander parkash a wetland ecologist and dr surinder singh also at guru nanak dev university amritsar found the highest average concentration of uranium  µgl in the town of bhucho mandi in bathinda district a short distance from the ash pond of lehra mohabat thermal power plant at village jai singh wala close to the batinda ash pond similar test results showed an average level of  µglin the last years more and more researchers came to the conclusion that geological causes are the main source of the uranium contamination in punjab as it is long known that in the underlying siwalik sediments uranium enrichments occur phadke et al  singh et al  patnaik et al  raju et al  of these findings sparked a controversy in the media as the government of punjab in april  ordered a probe into the matter and a series of tests with the bhabha atomic research centre trombay were conducted  it was later stated there is no side affect  of uranium and they have studied in the hair parts and the levels are very much below the levels so that cant cause any mental retardation or any abnormality  the government attributed the abnormalities to genetic disorders the local media however blamed the government for the absence of proper norms to monitor the environmental impact of ash ponds and lack of proper study of the prevalent uranium contamination in the regionin  under a greenpeace research laboratories investigation dr reyes tirado from the university of exeter uk  conducted a study in  villages in muktsar bathinda and ludhiana districts revealed chemical radiation and biological toxicity rampant in punjab   of the sampled wells showed nitrate levels above the safety limit of  mgl established by who the study connected it with high use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizerswith increasing poisoning of the soil the region once hailed as the home to the green revolution now due to excessive use of chemical fertilizer is being termed the other bhopal

during those timesaround  a fourth storey was added to the building without the necessary building permits followed by two more in  the civic authorities issued a notice of building code violation on the buildings management authorities in  the illegally constructed floors were  regularised by the payment of a penalty a mezzanine floor was also constructed between the ground floor and first floor the date of construction of which is not knownat the time of the construction and  regularisation of the two illegal floors the civic laws of kolkata required a fire clearance for any structure above the height of  metres  ft after the  regularisation of the additional floors the building did cross the   ft limit due to a loophole in the law the authorities did not have to obtain fire clearance as

fire broke out at stephen court thought to be from a short circuit from a lift in between the fifth and sixth floors the fire spread upwards and sideways engulfing the whole building in flames the

lack of maintenance of the building the liftman caretaker and assistant caretaker were immediately taken into custody two of the directors surrendered and the third was subsequently arrested in uttar pradeshthe government announced a probe of the incident a forensic team confirmed that the blaze had been started by a short circuit further investigation revealed a lack of maintenance of the electrical circuitry leading to exposed live wires in the basement which combined with the wooden main stairs made the building a tinderbox this had aided the fire in getting out of control as portions of the fifth and sixth floor had crumbled during the fire the kolkata municipal corporation on the advice of the forensic team took the decision to demolish the top two storeys of the building but had to stop the operations after a section of the owners moved the high court a few residents were allowed to use the building weeks after the fire but had to sign personal risk bonds absolving the civic authorities of any liability in case of injury for a period of six months moreover the supply of electricity and of water to the building were cut off by the kmc citing the precarious condition of the building major parts of the building including the lifts were out of bounds for those residentsin  an unregistered association the stephen court welfare association  took the initiative of restoring the heritage building by pooling a fund from the owners of the flats they repaired the broken pillars replaced the staircases and renovated the sootcovered exterior care

the accident the government of india decided to set up an independent air accident enquiry board called the civil aviation authority caa that would function independently of the dgca effectively this meant that the dgca would be the regulator and the caa the investigator the director general of the dgca said that it would be set up thorough legislation and would comply with the recommendations of the international civil aviation organizationthe enquiry report submitted by the civil aviation ministry said that glušica slept for over  minutes during the flight according to the ntsb it was the first instance of snoring recorded on a cvr analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot deployed detent reverse thrust and applied maximum manual braking at touchdown the aircraft could have stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway however the captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a goaround following deployment of the thrust reverserson  june  the government of india appointed the former vice chief of air staff air marshal bhushan nilkanth gokhale as head of a court of inquiry to investigate the air crash the gokhale inquiry was to investigate the reasons behind the crash and submit its findings by  august  a deadline later extended by a month to  september  the government also appointed four experts to this court of inquiry to assist in the investigation the court of inquiry started its investigations by visiting the crash site on  june  and visited all eight crash survivors to gather informationon  august  the court of inquiry began a threeday public hearing in mangalore to interview airport officials and witnesses on day one airport and airline officials deposed that the aircraft had approached at an altitude higher than usual and that it had landed beyond the landing zone ldz they also mentioned that the airports radar was operational from  may  the airport chief fire officer testified that crash tenders had taken four minutes to reach the aircraft because the road leading away from the airport perimeter to the crash site was very narrow and undulating on day two a transcript of the cockpit to atc conversation was released which indicated that the copilot had suggested a goaround after the pilot informed atc that it was clear to landdoctors who conducted post mortem examinations on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims had died of burns on day four air indias flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircrafts thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around the inquiry panel stated that information from the fdr would be released at the next hearing of the court of inquiry in new delhi on  september  and that of the cvr soon after the court of inquiry would submit its report on  september   september  details from the cvr and fdr were presented to the court of inquiry the cvr analysis revealed that one of the pilots was asleep in the cockpit for  minutes the cvr had picked up no conversation from the pilots with the report adding that the sound of nasal snoring and deep breathing could be heard during this recording the fdr analysis indicated that the flight started its final descent at an altitude of  feet  m instead of the normal  feet  m the aircraft also touched down at the   m mark on the runway instead of the   m mark whereupon the pilot then tried to take off with just  feet  m of the runway remaining which resulted in the crash both pilots had been aware of the wrong flight path since they are both heard saying flight is taking wrong path and wrong side while the aircrafts instruments had given repeated warnings of thison  november  five months after the court of inquiry was constituted it submitted its report with input from the ntsb and boeing and stated that the cause of this accident was the captains failure to discontinue the unstabilised approach despite three calls from the first officer to go around and warnings from the enhanced ground proximity warning system additional factors included the captains prolonged sleep during flight which could have led to sleep inertia and impaired judgment and the aircraft being given descent clearance closer to the airport than normal due to the unserviceability of the mangalore area control radar the flight crew did not plan the descent properly and was high on approachas of january  the dgca aai ministry of aviation and the government of india have not implemented the recommendations of the  crash inquiry committee

69,Cyclone Jal,October-November,2010,severe cyclonic storm jal was the fifth named cyclonic storm and the fourth severe cyclonic storm of the  north indian ocean cyclone season jal developed from a lowpressure area in the south china sea that organized into a tropical depression on october  jal is a sanskrit word meaning water at least  people are known to have been killed in india as a tropical depression jal produced torrential rains over parts of thailand and malaysia triggering severe flooding which killed  and four people in the two countries respectively in sri lanka heavy rainfall with strong winds have caused flooding affecting around  people in thailand jal was responsible for  deaths being the  deadliest tropical cyclone in the countryon october  a weak tropical disturbance formed within a monsoonal trough of low pressure in the south china sea just off the eastern coast of borneo for the next few weeks the system stalled on the eastern coast of bormeo remaining disorganized while the system barely affected the island of borneo at all during the last week of october the storm detached from the moonsonal trough and began slowly moving east on october  the japan meteorological agency jma and the joint typhoon warning center jtwc both reported that the system had begun to develop already beginning to organize itself about  km  mi to the southeast of ho chi minh city vietnam during the next few days the tropical depression strengthened slowly as it slowly moved towards the eastern border of the indian ocean during this time convection around the disturbance increased but failed to organize around the storms low level circulation center despite these unfavorable conditions the storm managed to develop convection around its area of low pressure and organized itself significantly on october  the thai and malaysian meteorological departments tmd reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression and initiated advisories on the system from october  continuing into november  the storm strengthened slightly as it continued moving towards the indian ocean but not enough for it to become a tropical storm late on november  the tropical depression crossed the malay peninsula and entered the extreme eastern part of the indian ocean causing the west pacific agencies to cancel all their advisories on the storm as it was no longer in the west pacific ocean as soon as the system entered the extreme eastern border of the indian ocean the india meteorological agency imd immediately declared the storm a depression and began issuing advisories on the system because the system had already organized itself into a tropical depression in the west pacific ocean on october  which was a day before the system entered the imds area of responsibility later on november  the system began showing signs of further but slow organization as the system continued moving west slowly early on november  the malaysian meteorological department mmd also issued their first advisory on the system and the imd simply called it depression becausing the storm had not yet entered the bay of bengal later on that day the imd reported that the system had weakened into an area of low pressure due to the effects of crossing the malay peninsula but they forecast it to become a depression soon again as the storm was moving over warm water late on november  the joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system as it began reorganizing itself early on november  the india meteorological department imd upgraded the area of low pressure to a depression again this time giving it the designation bob  as the system had now entered the bay of bengal on november  the joint typhoon warning center jtwc designated the system as tropical cyclone  on november  the imd upgraded depression bob  to a deep depression later the deep depression strengthened further prompting the imd to upgrade it to a cyclonic storm and was named jal the storm continued to grow and became a severe cyclonic storm by november  soon afterward it was upgraded to a category  tropical cyclone by the jtwc on november  jal started weakening soon afterward the imd reported that jal weakened into a cyclonic storm later that day the jtwc downgraded jal into a tropical storm late on the same day the imd reported that the storm weakened into a deep depression as a deep depression the system made landfall at chennai a few hours later the system continued to weaken and became a depression by early hours of november  the depression continued to weaken until it dissipated into a remnant low on the same day while on that very same day the imd said that there is a possibility of restrengthening of jals remnants over north east arabian sea and as the imd said the system moved into the arabian sea without weakening by early november  but instead of moving across the arabian sea the depression moved north along the western coast of india restrengthening slightly but not enough for it to regenerate within a few hours the storm started moving inland due to the prevailing winds the system rapidly weakened as it moved farther inland over the next few days causing severe flooding along the way early on november  the remnants of cyclone jal were completely absorbed by a nontropical low over the himalayaswhen jal was just a lowpressure area it hit thailand and strengthened into a depression as a result heavy to very heavy rains battered the country causing extensive flooding and claimed  livesthe

109,Cyclone Hudhud,October 12,2014,extremely severe cyclonic storm hudhud was a strong tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage and loss of life in eastern india and nepal during october  hudhud originated from a lowpressure system that formed under the influence of an upperair cyclonic circulation in the andaman sea on october  hudhud intensified into a cyclonic storm on october  and as a severe cyclonic storm on october  hudhud underwent rapid deepening in the following days and was classified as a very severe cyclonic storm by the imd shortly before landfall near visakhapatnam andhra pradesh on october  hudhud reached its peak strength with threeminute wind speeds of  kmh  mph and a minimum central pressure of  mbar  inhg the system then drifted northwards towards uttar pradesh

april  with a magnitude of  or  and a maximum mercalli intensity of viii severe its epicenter was east of gorkha district at barpak gorkha and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately  km  mi it was the worst natural disaster to strike nepal since the  nepal–bihar earthquake the ground motion recorded in the capital of nepal was of low frequency which along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors decreased the loss of property and human livesthe earthquake triggered an avalanche on mount everest killing  making  april  the deadliest day on the mountain in history the earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the langtang valley where  people were reported missinghundreds of thousands of nepalese were made homeless with entire villages flattened across many districts of the country centuriesold buildings were destroyed at unesco world heritage sites in the kathmandu valley including some at the kathmandu durbar square the patan durbar square the bhaktapur durbar square the changu narayan temple the boudhanath stupa and the swayambhunath stupa geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake particularly because of its geology urbanization and architecture dharahara also called bhimsen tower a ninestorey   ft tall tower was destroyed it was a part of the architecture of kathmandu recognized by unescocontinued aftershocks occurred throughout nepal at the intervals of – minutes with one shock reaching a magnitude of  on  april at  nst the country also had a continued risk of landslidesa major aftershock occurred on  may  at  nst with a moment magnitude mw of  the epicenter was near the chinese border between the capital of kathmandu and mount everest more than  people were killed and over  were injured by this aftershock and many were left homelessthe earthquake occurred on  april  at  am nst  utc at a depth of approximately  km  mi which is considered shallow and therefore more damaging than quakes that originate deeper in the ground with its epicentre approximately  km  mi eastsoutheast of lamjung nepal lasting approximately fifty seconds the earthquake was initially reported as  mw by the united states geological survey usgs before it was quickly upgraded to  mw the china earthquake networks center cenc reported the earthquakes magnitude to be  ms the india meteorological department imd said two powerful quakes were registered in nepal at  utc and  utc the first quake measured  mw and its epicenter was identified at a distance of  km to the northwest of kathmandu the capital of nepal bharatpur was the nearest major city to the main earthquake  km  mi as the crow flies from the epicenter the second earthquake was somewhat less powerful at  mw it occurred  km  mi east of kathmandu and its seismic focus lay at a depth of  km  mi below the earths surface over thirtyeight aftershocks of magnitude  mw or greater occurred in the day following the initial earthquake including the one of magnitude  mwaccording to the usgs the earthquake was caused by a sudden thrust or release of builtup stress along the major fault line where the indian plate carrying india is slowly diving underneath the eurasian plate carrying much of europe and asia kathmandu situated on a block of crust approximately  km  miles wide and  km  miles long rapidly shifted  m  ft to the south in a matter of just  secondsthe risk of a large earthquake was well known beforehand in  in an interview with seismologist vinod kumar gaur the hindu quoted him as saying calculations show that there is sufficient accumulated energy  now to produce an  magnitude earthquake i cannot say when it may not happen tomorrow but it could possibly happen sometime this century or wait longer to produce a much larger one according to brian tucker founder of a nonprofit organization devoted to reducing casualties from natural disasters some government officials had expressed confidence that such an earthquake would not occur again tucker recounted a conversation he had had with a government official in the  who said we dont have to worry about earthquakes anymore because we already had an earthquake the previous earthquake to which he referred occurred in  lies towards the southern limit of the diffuse collisional boundary where the indian plate underthrusts the eurasian plate occupying the central sector of the himalayan arc nearly onethird of the  km  mi long himalayas geologically the nepal himalayas are subdivided into five tectonic zones from north to south and east to west and almost parallel to subparallel these five distinct morphogeotectonic zones are  terai plain  sub himalaya shivalik range  lesser himalaya mahabharat range and mid valleys  higher himalaya and  inner himalaya tibetan tethys each of these zones is clearly identified by its morphological geological and tectonic featuresthe convergence rate between the plates in central nepal is about  mm  in per year the location magnitude and focal mechanism of the earthquake suggest that it was caused by a slip along the main frontal thrustthe earthquakes effects were amplified in kathmandu as it sits on the kathmandu basin which contains up to  m  ft of sedimentary rocks representing the infilling of a lakebased on a study published in  of the main frontal thrust on average a great earthquake occurs every  ±  and  ±  years in the east nepal region a study from  found a  delay between earthquakes in the region the study also suggests that because of tectonic stress buildup the earthquake from  in nepal and the  quake are connected following a historic earthquake pattern a  study on historical great m ≥  earthquake pairs and cycles found that associated great earthquakes are likely to occur in the west china region through the  to the usgs website the maximum intensity was viii severe in most of kathmandu the intensity was vi as evidenced by the numerous undamaged water towers installed on top of undamaged multi story buildings tremors were felt in the neighboring indian states of bihar uttar pradesh assam west bengal sikkim jharkhand uttarakhand gujarat in the national capital region around new delhi and as far south as karnataka damage was extensive in northern bihar and minor damage was also reported from parts of odisha shaking was felt in highrise buildings as far as kochi in the southern state of kerala the intensity in patna was v moderate the intensity was iv light in dhaka bangladesh the earthquake was also experienced across southwest china ranging from the tibet autonomous region to chengdu which is  km  mi away from the epicenter tremors were felt in pakistan and bhutana series of aftershocks began immediately after the mainshock at intervals of – minutes with one aftershock reaching  within  minutes of the initial quake a major aftershock of magnitude  mw occurred on  april  in the same region at  nst  utc with an epicenter located about  km  mi south of kodari nepal the aftershock caused fresh avalanches on mount everest and was felt in many places in northern india including kolkata siliguri jalpaiguri and assam the aftershock caused a landslide on the koshi highway which blocked the section of the road between bhedetar and mulghata model of geogateway based on a united states geological survey mechanism of a nearhorizontal fault as well as location of aftershocks showed that the fault had an ° dip towards the north striking at °  km  mi wide  km  mi long and had a dip slip of  m  ft the usgs says the aftershock registered at a shallow depth of  km  mias of  may   aftershocks had occurred with different epicenters and magnitudes equal to or above  mw out of which  aftershocks are equal to or above  mw and  aftershocks above  mw and more than  aftershocks less than  mwa second major earthquake occurred on  may  at  nst with a moment magnitude mw of   km  mi southeast of kodari the epicenter was near the chinese border between the capital city of kathmandu and mount everest it struck at the depth of  km  miles this earthquake occurred along the same fault as the original magnitude  earthquake of  april but further to the east as such it is considered to be an aftershock of  april quake tremors were also felt in northern parts of india including bihar uttar pradesh west bengal and other northindian states at least  died in nepal as a result of the aftershock and about  were injured  others died in india two in bangladesh and one in chinadisastrous events in very poor and politically paralyzed nations such as nepal often become a long drawn out chain of events in that one disaster feeds into another for years or even decades upon end the aftereffects from the earthquake had subsequent effects on a myriad of things human trafficking labour cost and availability rental and property cost burdens urbanization private and public debt burdens mental health politics tourism disease and damage to the healthcare system a survey some  months afterwards found only  of the reconstruction money had been distributed and those without land were locked out of financial support exacerbating the social divide and feeding marginalizationsome disasters that came with the monsoon season were suspected to be related to the earthquake there was a landslip on  june that claimed  lives meanwhile a glacial lake had burst in particularly hard hit solukhumbhu district whether or not the quake had contributed to such events is often unknown and unresearched but certainly possiblethe earthquake killed more than  people in nepal and injured nearly three times as many the rural death toll may have been minimized by the fact that most villagers were outdoors working when the quake hit as of  may  people including  from the  may aftershock were still receiving treatment for their injuries nearly  million people were left homelessthe example of this earthquake shows that loss calculations for hypothetical likely future earthquakes can be reasonably reliable in  the expected numbers of fatalities due to a hypothetical scenario earthquake near kathmandu for  was published the fatalities at that time were estimated between  and  the  earthquake of  april  killed about  people because it occurred on a saturday and so many buildings that collapsed such as schools and municipal buildings were empty reducing the death toll in addition the epicentre of the earthquake was in a rural setting so the worst hit districts had low population densities and most of the population was outside when the earthquake hit had the earthquake occurred at night or during the working week when many more people were inside vulnerable buildings the death toll would have likely been much closer to the modelled estimate after the rupture area of the kathmandu  earthquake had been derived and the intensities of shaking had been mapped a line source model for losses could be constructed with energy being radiated along the entire rupture the fatalities estimated in this way by qlarm agree with those reported in the end the figure shows reports of fatalities as a function of time news reports significantly underestimated the actual numbers of fatalities for several daysthe himalayan times reported that as many as  foreign nationals may have been visiting nepal at the time of the earthquake although reports of foreign deaths were relatively lowa total of  deaths were reported in india – including  in bihar  in uttar pradesh  in west bengal and  in  dead and  missing all from the tibet autonomous  deadthis earthquake caused avalanches on mount everest at least  died with at least  others injured or missingin the langtang valley located in langtang national park  people were reported missing after an avalanche hit the village of ghodatabela and the village of langtang the avalanche was estimated to have been two to three kilometres wide ghodatabela was an area popular on the langtang trekking route the village of langtang was destroyed by the avalanche smaller settlements on the outskirts of langtang were buried during the earthquake such as chyamki thangsyap and mundu twelve locals and two foreigners were believed to have survived smaller landslides occurred in the trishuli river valley with reports of significant damage at mailung simle and archale on  may it was announced that  bodies had been found in the langtang area of which seven were of foreignersaccording to geological models the frequency and intensity of future landslides in the langtang valley is due to increase in the coming decades this is attributable directly to the effect of the earthquake which caused widespread fracturing in the grounds of the langtang areathousands of houses were destroyed across many districts of the country with entire villages flattened especially those near the epicenterthe tribhuvan international airport serving kathmandu was closed immediately after the earthquake but was reopened later in the day for relief operations and later for some commercial flights it subsequently shut down operations sporadically due to aftershocks and on  may was closed temporarily to the largest planes for fear of runway damage during strong aftershocks the airport opened all boardinglounge exit doors onto the tarmac allowing people who were waiting post security and immigration to flee to the open spaces of the runway tarmac many remained outside as planes were delayed and the airport swelled to capacity the airport facilities suffered damage and there was no running water or operating toilets in the airport lounges few airport workers were at their posts most were killed in the earthquake or had to deal with its aftereffectsflights resumed from pokhara to the west of the epicentre on  aprilseveral of the churches in the kathmandu valley were destroyed as saturday is the principal day of christian worship in nepal  people were reported to have died in the collapsesseveral temples on kathmandu durbar square a unesco world heritage site collapsed as did the dharahara

historian prushottam lochan shrestha stated we have lost most of the monuments that had been designated as world heritage sites in kathmandu bhaktapur and lalitpur district nepal they cannot be restored to their original states the northeastern parts of india also received major damage heavy shocks were felt in the states of uttrakhand uttar pradesh west bengal and others huge damage was caused to the property and the lives of the peopleconcern was expressed that harvests could be reduced or lost this season as people affected by the earthquake would have only a short time to plant crops before the onset of the monsoon rainsnepal with a total gross domestic product of  billion according to a  estimate is one of asias poorest countries and has little ability to fund a major reconstruction effort on its own even before the quake the asian development bank estimated that it would need to spend about four times more than it currently does annually on infrastructure through to  to attract investment the us geological survey initially estimated economic losses from the tremor at  per cent to  per cent of gross domestic product with a best guess of  per cent its too hard for now to tell the extent of the damage and the effect on nepals gdp according to hun kim an asian development bank adb official the adb said on the  that it would provide a  million grant to nepal for immediate relief efforts and up to  million for the first phase of rehabilitationrajiv biswas an economist at a coloradobased consultancy said that rebuilding the economy will need international effort over the next few years as it could easily exceed  billionit was reported that the survivors were preyed upon by human traffickers involved in the supply of girls and women to the brothels of south asia these traffickers took advantage of the chaos that resulted from the aftermath of the earthquake the most affected were women from poor communities who lost their homesin response to the unsafe conditions of the temporary campsites international organizations implemented safety committees which were provided cash grants for necessities like additional toilets and bathroomssingle women had very little access to relief according to a report by the interparty womens alliance ipwa the report also found that violence and rapes against women and minors has increased after the earthquake additionally the earthquake has significantly affected certain groups of people tibetoburman peoples were hardest hit as they tend to inhabit the higher slopes of mountains as opposed to the central valleys and are less educated and connected all of these factors make them harder to access according to a government survey malnutrition in children has worsened considerably some  months after the quake with the most undernourished being tamang and chepang peoples before the quake  percent of children under five were stunted  percent were underweight and  percent were emaciated according to the world food programmethough a feared mass cholera outbreak failed to materialize there were sporadic reports other outbreaks were reported at least  people died of scrub typhus while  people were taken ill since the disease was first diagnosed in the country in august  until september  the mental and emotional impact of an earthquake is the other invisible disasterabout  of soldiers from the

132,Uttarakhand forest fires,April–May,2016,the  uttarakhand forest fires were a series of widespread damaging wildfires that took place in uttarakhand india between april and may the fires were caused by a heatwave that spread across uttarakhand and were the worst recorded in the region with a reported  hectares  acres of forest burnt down and seven people deadofficials detected nearly  total fires which were brought under control by  may and as rain fell the following day it reduced the impact of the wildfires an initial report on  may noted that  hectares  acres had been destroyed by the fireforest fires caused by humans in the himalayan state of uttarakhand have been a regular event since the formation of the state in  more than  hectares  acres of forest land has been lost to firesome fires during   and  have been associated with popular movements against the then british governments forestry policies and as a call for independence most of these fires occur in the chir pine pinus roxburghii zone which is prone to fire but the pine itself is resistant to the fire instead of harming them these fires help in their regeneration by reducing coverage of broadleaf trees which leads to an increase in the land covered by chir pine and oak the broadleaved forest is dominated by oak species including banj oak quercus leucotrichophora resin is harvested from these pines and fires are often intentionally set to remove the carpet of pine needles that come in the way of harvesting activity in june  a blanket ban was introduced against the felling of standing trees  meters above sea level a ban that prohibits the removal of pine trees in the areas where they are invading apart from accidental fires several causes and motivations for setting fires have been noted which include encroachment on forest lands and concealing illegal timber extraction major illicit timber trade relies on pine forests since it is often used for constructiona major cause for the fires was attributed to the record high temperatures and severe lack of rainfall due to a dry winter the uttarakhand forest fires had also come as india suffered one of its worst droughts in years with the government noting over  million were affected by water shortagesthe forest fires began on february   and went initially unnoticed for several weeks while parliament was in a state of outrage over the presidential rule which had been imposed on uttarakhandconsequently these fires went largely unchecked and spread from the pine forests on the slopes of the subhimalayan region to the oak and broadleaf forests which resulted in heavy clouds of smoke that changed the usually blue skies to grey this smoke affected tourism within the state and fearing bad publicity the locals did not report the firesthe conservationist ela smetacek started a public awareness campaign to highlight the damage from the fires calling on the indian government to address the issue her facebook post was shared over  times as it showed the entire hillsides ablaze with walls of flames engulfing even the tallest treesthe campaign gathered widespread support from social media users and indian media which led to a series of claims and counterclaims between the environment minister the conservationist and other activists ensued as smetacek blamed the timber and builder mafia for the purposelylit fires stating that  fires could be seen from nasa satellite pictures and that an arson attack across the state was evident the post demanding the fires be recognized as a national emergency and the need of immediate deployment of ndrf teams led to the government taking action deploying the national disaster response force and making use of indian air force  helicopters fitted with bambi buckets to douse the fires with waterseven fatalities were reported as of  may  the pinegrove school a boarding school at kasauli was evacuated as fires had reached its compound walls tourism and wildlife at the jim corbett national park and rajaji tiger reserve regions were affected various other locations in these himalayan states of uttarakhand and himachal pradesh are tourist attractions in summer and they now face heavy air pollution the forest fires also disrupted the functioning of the kalka–shimla railway line on  may the forest department estimated the monetary losses at approximately ₹ lakh  the estimate is based on the standard rule book followed by the department with empirical formulae for such calculations various ecologists and environmental activists have disregarded the estimate noting that it does not take into account ecological and wildlife losses they added that these fires have also destroyed vegetation which holds rainfall which might result in floods in the monsoon seasonscientists of the govind ballabh pant institute of himalayan environment and development formed a team to survey the area and study the effects of the fires on the melting of glaciers ecologists suggested that clearing of forest floors of the fallen pine leaves which are readily combustible should be undertaken by the forest department as well as locals on a grassroots level to prevent such major fire outbreaks production of biomass briquettes from these pine needles should be promoted serving as a source of fuel as well as a solution to prevent wildfires on  april the national disaster response force was deployed for rescue operations in the kumaon and garhwal areas around  personnel from the forest department were deployed as of  april   incidences of fire were reported affecting around  hectares  acres of forest area the  helicopters of the indian air force with bambi buckets were used to douse the fires with water however the heavy smog that developed in the area affected the aerial operations of the army the affected area later increased to around  hectares  acres extending into himachal pradesh the regions saw rainfalls on  may ranging from  to  which helped in controlling the firesoaring temperatures reignited the forest fires on  may  covering an area of nearly  hectares of green land spreading over  districts rangers and divisional forest officers rush to the spot and extinguish the fire as soon as possible to reduce the damage done this was the result of the temperatures of uttarakhand which were about  to  degrees higher than the average temperatures at this time of the year according to government sources the forest fires combined have destroyed nearly  hectares of land in  incidentssubsequently the world bank granted  crores rupees  to the uttarakhand forest department to research the cause of the forest fires which was later increased by ₹ crores  indian central government later announced a series of funds amounting to over ₹ crores  to go towards afforestation across the state of uttarakhand and the countryreports were published in the local media which variously blamed both the local people and timber companies for the forest fires environmental journalist bahar dutt blamed the television media for their delhi centrist world view that disregarded the historical and ecological natural causes of fire due to the high density of pine trees that increases the fire hazards various tourismrelated associations suggested that the exaggerated representation of the fires by the media could reduce tourism a major part of the state economy part of a team of conservationists and biologists who studied the private and state forests since  smetacek maintained forest fires did not occur naturally in the geographical topography of the region concerned natural fires are not seen anywhere in indian forests she added the introduction of pine trees by the british caused a more volatile fuel to the manmade firesfires directly destroy biodiversity and have indirect longterm impacts including the encouragement of fire and pioneer species it has been suggested that the dark carbon dust emitted by the fires deposited on himalayan glaciers could hasten the glaciers melting this could affect the hydrology of the rivers that are a source of water for human populations in northern india the average temperature of northern india saw an increase of  °c,2016-04-01

165,2018 Kerala flood,August,2018,on  august  severe floods affected the south indian state kerala due to unusually high rainfall during the monsoon season it was the worst flood in kerala in nearly a century over  people died and  are missing about a million people were evacuated mainly from chengannur pandanad edanad aranmula kozhencherry ayiroor ranni pandalam kuttanad malappuram aluva chalakudy thrissur thiruvalla eraviperoor vallamkulam north paravur chellanam vypin island and palakkad all  districts of the state were placed on red alert according to the kerala government onesixth of the total population of kerala had been directly affected by the floods and related incidents the indian government had declared it a level  calamity or calamity of a severe nature it is the worst flood in kerala after the great flood of  that took place in  out of the  dams within the state were opened for the first time in history all five overflow gates of the idukki dam were opened at the same time and for the first time in  years  gates of the malampuzha dam of palakkad were opened heavy rains in wayanad and idukki have caused severe landslides and have left the hilly districts isolated the situation was regularly monitored by the national crisis management committee which also coordinated the  rescue and relief operations as the dam got opened it has disrupted many lives living nearbykerala received heavy monsoon rainfall which was about  more than the usual rain fall in kerala on the midevening of  august resulting in dams filling to their maximum capacities in the first  hours of rainfall the state received  mm  in of rain almost all dams had been opened since the water level had risen close to overflow level due to heavy rainfall flooding local lowlying areas for the first time in the states history  of its  dams had been opened the deluge has been considered an impact of the global warmingindependent scientific studies conducted by hydrology experts from iit madras purdue university and iit gandhinagar concluded that it was the heavy downpour that resulted it the floods and not the dam management based on a computersimulation of flood storage and flow patterns by a team of researchers from iit madras and purdue university it was found that the devastation wrought by the floods cannot be attributed to the release of water from dams further the scientists added that the odds of such floods were  and no reservoir management could have considered such scenarios hydrology expert from iit gandhinagar prof vimal mishra identified four major factors for the floods unexpected above normal downpour extreme rainfall events occurring almost across kerala during the season over  reservoir storage even before the onset of extreme rainfall events and finally the unprecedented extreme rainfall in the catchment areas of major reservoirs in the state led to the disaster the prime reason for the anomalous rainfall in  is the highfrequency mixed rossbygravity waves in the midtroposphere triggered by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical pacific  these highfrequency waves manifested as cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and dilated the wind field to establish zones of convection in the tropics as they propagated across the indian ocean basin although the maddenjulian oscillation phase with – days period has favored convection in the tropics the highfrequency mode correlates better with the anomalous precipitation during the intervals of extreme events expert bodies like the central water commission has corroborated the findings by scientists from iit madras purdue university and iit gandhinagara report by adv jacob p alex an amicus curiae appointed by the kerala high court alleged that the devastating floods of  was the result of bad dam management by the state government all  dams in the state were maintained with the objective to generate hydroelectricity or irrigation and controlling flood wasnt their purpose amicus curiae jacob p alexs report highlighted the major concern of the dam operators was to maximise reservoir levels which conflicted with the flood control purpose for which the dams could be utilised the flood cushion of reservoirs – the storage space earmarked in dams to absorb unanticipated high flows – needed review as per the latest guidelines alex wrote in his report sudden release of water simultaneously from different reservoirs during extreme rainfall aggravated the damageit said adding that various alerts —blue orange and red—had been issued not in accordance with the eap guideline no proper followup action and effective precautionary steps especially for evacuating people and accommodating them in safe location were taken after issuance of red alert it said however honorable high court of kerala cleared on  august  that the amicus curiae report is not accepted and court cannot be used for political battles and argumentsthe government of kerala argued in the supreme court that the very sudden release of water from the mullaperiyar dam by the tamil nadu government was one of the reasons for the devastating flood in kerala the tamil nadu government rejected the argument saying that kerala suffered the deluge due to the discharge of excess water from  reservoirs across kerala spurred by heavy rains from within the state it also argued that the flood surplus from the idukki dam is mainly due to the flows generated from its own independent catchment due to unprecedented heavy rainfall while the discharge from mullaperiyar dam was significantly less though it is difficult to attribute any single event to climate change its possible role in causing the heavy rainfall event over kerala cannot be ruled outover  people died and  are missing while the economic times reported that  people were rescued the kerala state disaster management authority has placed the state in a red alert as a result of the intense flooding a number of water treatment plants were forced to cease pumping water resulting in poor access to clean water especially in northern districts of the stateover  relief camps have been opened at various locations to accommodate the flood victims it is estimated that  people have found shelter in such camps the flooding has affected hundreds of villages destroyed an estimated  km  mi of roads and thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed the government cancelled onam celebrations and the allocated funds have been reallocated to relief effortson  august cochin international airport

that they received no such offer for financial help from any country the uae ambassador to india also declared that officially there was no announcement on donation to the state of keralaweek by week departures from normalpercentage increase in rainfall compared to normalaccording to a study by the central water commission the average cumulative rainfall of  days from  to  august  was about  mm this was almost of the same order as that of rainfall of devikulam which occurred during – july  assuming a runoff coefficient of  the runoff generated by  days of intense rainfall was estimated to be  mcm for the entire state of kerala this huge runoff was beyond the carrying capacity of most of the rivers in kerala resulting in bank overflows from most of the riversthe total catchment area tapped by dams in kerala excluding barrages is about    sq mi the runoff generated from the catchment tapped by these dams during the period – august  was estimated at  bcm out of a total runoff of  bcm for the whole of kerala as per the study with a total live storage in the state of  bcm and assuming a live storage availability of  on  august  the extent of available flood moderation would have only been  bcm against an estimated inflow of  bcm it was therefore essential to make releases from the reservoirsthe study stated that the dams in kerala neither added to the flood nor helped in reduction of flood as most of the dams were already at or very close to frl on  august  even if the reservoirs had been a few feet below fl the flooding conditions would not have changed much as the heavy rainfall continued for – days it would have been necessary to release water from the reservoirs after the first day of heavy rainfallthe study concluded it would be necessary to review the rule curves of all reservoirs in kerala especially those with a live storage capacity of more than  mcm this would help to create a dynamic flood cushion for moderating floodsduring the time period of  days from  to  august  the rainfall depth realized in the periyar basin was  mm the maximum discharge passing through the periyar at neeleeswaram was  cumecs  recorded at  august  hrs as per the cwcs neeleeswaram gd site the major storage reservoirs in the periyar basin are the idukki reservoir  bcm and the idamalayar reservoir  bcm the peak release on  august  from the idukki reservoir  was  cumecs against an inflow of  cumecs thus achieving a flood moderation of  cumecs the release from idamalayar on  august  was  cumecs against an inflow of  cumecsthe discharge at neeleshwaram on  august  was  cumecs the release from idukki and idamalayar reservoirs were  cumecs with an inflow of  cumecs and  cumecs inflow of  cumecs cwcs analysis found that the releases of water were controlled releases as the discharge capacity of idukki and idamalayar dams are  cumecs and  cumecs respectivelya few days after receiving one of the highest rainfalls in  century kerala was caught under the threat of severe drought water level in wells ponds and rivers have recorded lowest levels and some wells even collapsed chief minister pinarayi vijayan has directed the state council for science technology  environment to carry out studies on the phenomenon after floods across the state and suggest possible solutions to the problemab anita executive director centre for water resource development management cwrdm an autonomous research institution under the state government said heavy runoff of the top soil in the upland areas and the siltation in the rivers were the reasons for the falling water level the top soil in the hills and upland areas had been removed in the flash floods to a depth of up to two metres in many places as the top soil was shaved off it ruined the hills capacity to sponge in rainwater she said ms anita cited ecological destruction caused by deforestation harmful land use in the upland areas and sand mining in the streams and rivers as having contributed to the top soil runoff and siltation this was exacerbated by the impact of climate change at the macro levelechoing her views experts at the national institute of technology calicut nitc said it was usual for the water level in the rivers and domestic wells to fall after fluvial floods normally a river flows through the sand of its own bearing till the mouth however this time the discharge has been full taking the sand and the rocks in the youthstage along with the floods so the water level in the rivers comes down and when the river water level is reduced the groundwater table also does not get replenished since the rivers and groundwater table are connected said k saseendran geologist and professor at the nitc,2018-08-01

deaths reported in other parts of the country in pakistan five infants died after extreme heat exposurethe heat wave coincided with extreme droughts and water shortages across india and pakistan in midjune reservoirs that previously supplied chennai ran dry depriving millions the water crisis was exacerbated by high temperatures and lack of preparation causing protests and fights that sometimes led to killing and stabbingheat waves worldwide have become more extreme and more frequent due to humaninfluenced climate change and global warming since  india and pakistan have experienced  of its  warmest recorded years the frequency and duration of heat waves in india and pakistan has increased the indian institute of tropical meteorology has identified several contributing factors including el niño modoki an irregular el niño in which the central pacific ocean is warmer than the eastern part and the loss of tree cover which reduces shade increasing temperatures and reduces moisture in soil which results in less evapotranspiration and more heat transfer into the atmospherein response to the growing number of deaths from heat waves the indian government although not addressing the root causes began implementing measures intended to save lives in  in ahmedabad for example school days were reduced government work programs ceased and free water was distributed in busy areas public gardens were opened during the daytime so that people could seek shade professor of public health parthasarathi ganguly estimated that  fewer people died in  as a result of these policiesin india the

occurred in multiple states across india and pakistan worsening heat wave conditions in chennai millions of people are without consistent access to water a lack of rainwater and groundwater has left four of the reservoirs that supply the city completely dry the inability to meet demand for water has forced businesses like hotels and restaurants to close water tankers from areas of tamil nadu

monkeys were found dead in a forest in madhya pradesh possibly as a result of the heat wave veterinarian arun mishra says this may have happened due to a conflict over water with a larger group of – monkeys mishra said this was rare and strange because herbivores do not usually engage in such conflictsthe heat wave is a possible aggravating factor in an encephalitis outbreak in bihar which has killed over  children since  junethe indian national disaster management authority ndma had a goal for keeping heat related deaths this year to single digits in  the heat wave death toll was kept at  through public safety measures for example government workers across the country conducted awareness campaigns and distributed free water however in  the national general election took place and

more than  children mainly due to hypoglycemia in subsequent months more cases and deaths were reported the cause of outbreak is unclear malnutrition climate hygiene inadequate health facilities and lack of awareness are considered as contributing factors the lychee fruit toxins are also cited as plausible cause of aesoutbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome aes have occurred previously in the northern regions of bihar state and eastern regions of uttar pradesh state of india the first case of aes in muzaffarpur district was recorded in  there were  deaths in   in   in  four in   in  and  in  in most recent years the death toll had remained under  june  an outbreak of aes occurred in  blocks of muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in biharas a result of the outbreak total  children died in first three weeks of june  a total of  cases of aes were admitted to hospitals in these three weeks at least  children of them died at the sri krishna medical college and hospital skmch the

july august and september at skmch   and at least  cases were reported total  cases of aes including  deaths were reported between  june and  september  term acute encephalitis syndrome aes was coined by the world health organisation in  the symptoms of aes include an acute onset of fever and associated clinical neurological manifestations such as mental confusion disorientation delirium convulsions or coma early symptoms include headaches and vomiting along with sudden hypoglycemia drops in blood sugar levels but may lead to coma brain dysfunctions and inflammation of the heart and lungs those that survive aes may have longterm neurological weaknesses the severe hypoglycemia can cause death the syndrome is locally known as chamki bukhar in biharthe cause of the outbreak is unclearaes can be caused by different microorganisms including virus bacteria fungi parasites and spirochetes as well as chemicals and toxins aes mostly affects children below  in india aes was chiefly associated with japanese encephalitis virus jev before  the jev cases and outbreaks became more frequent and endemic regions developed between  and  after  nonjev cases and outbreaks of aes were increasingly reported caused by other viruses including chandipura virus chpv nipah virus niv and enteroviruses after  it is observed that the cause shifting to jev initial examination shows little sign of the jev or other viral routes in the affected children a study by aiims patna found the presence of enterovirushigh temperature humidity malnutrition poor hygiene and lack of awareness are known aggravating factors of aes cases of aes tend to occur during the countrys monsoon season in june  the temperature in muzaffarpur had remained above  °c  °f and the rains were delayed which might have aggravated the situation it was the secondlongest heatwave in the region poverty and malnutrition is widespread among children in the region malnourished children lack a buffer stock of sugar as glycogen in the liver which puts them at higher risk of hypoglycemia awareness campaigns were carried out in march–april  but were not conducted later due to the  indian general elections the local administration was not watchful due to the few cases of aes in recent yearsthe region is the largest producer of lychee fruits in india a  study published in lancet found that the methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid and hypoglycin a found in unripe lychee litchi chinensis fruit can cause hypoglycemia and cited them as plausible cause of aes outbreaks a diet heavy on unripe lychee fruits without having an otherwise full meal later in the day may put malnourished children at risk of hypoglycemia others disputed the findings citing the unlikeliness of very large consumption of unripe lychee fruits lack of cases in healthy wellnourished children and many other pediatric illnesses causing hypoglycemia health officials reported that most of the victims suffered severe hypoglycemiathe

memorialon  march  the prime minister tweeted that he would not be participating in holi programmes due to  the pandemic and subsequent lockdown resulted in numerous religious festivals being largely celebrated within homes or seeing less than normal public turnouts adhering to social distancing guidelines the char dham was conducted in a controlled manner in  pilgrims numbered  while the previous year had seen  pilgrims many religious institutions adapted and connected to their devotees via livestreaming radio and television purported superspreader events of a religious nature included the  tablighi jamaat  hotspot in delhi and the  haridwar kumbh mela the state of uttarakhand where the kumbh took place saw a  increase in  transmission during the period when kumbh was held  saw numerous religious events ignoring social distancing guidelines such as holi and eidover  of indias population ie over  million people in india live in rural areas the share of covid cases in rural and semirural india increased from  in midjuly  to  in august  this increase in covid cases was largely attributed to the movement of covid infected migrant workers from urban areas back to their native villages issues aggravating the situation in rural and semirural areas include a severe lack of human resources in the health field the second wave also saw migrants coming back from urbans areas indicated by the sharp rise in employment generation through mgnregs by may  more than half the cases in maharashtra and uttar pradesh were from rural areas another indicator of the situation in villages is the rush of villagers to semiurban and urban areas in search of healthcare about – per cent of the patients in hospitals in bhopal are from villages and small towns located within a  km radius its the same story in indore on  may  a up government official confirmed the report that corpses of people who succumbed to the virus in the rural areas had been dumped in the ganges river due

with respect to deaths between  and  june   million tests were reconciledundercounting of total cases and death figures was reported during the first wave in  the discrepancies were detected by comparing official death counts released by the governments to the number of deaths reported in obituaries at crematoria and burial grounds etc some states were reported to have not added suspected cases to the final count contrary to who guidelines similar undercounting was reported during the second wave in  there have been large gaps noted between official death figures and the sudden increase in the number of bodies being cremated and buried several crematoria that had been in disuse earlier were brought back into operation to keep up with the demanda series of articles in the hindu newspaper estimated that compared to previous years the number of additional deaths during the pandemic known as the excess mortality was about four times the official covid death toll in chennai kolkata and mumbai and could be up to ten times higher in the state of gujarat however it is not clear what proportion of these are due to covid and what are due to other factors such as overcrowding of medical facilities lockdown etc a report by the center for global development stated that the second wave of  in india was the worst tragedy since the partition the report based on serosurveys household data and official data pointed towards a significant underreporting of deaths with estimates ranging from about  million to  million deaths overall with central estimates varying between  and  million deathson the evening of  april two reporters from the gujarati language newspaper sandesh and a photojournalist staked out the mortuary of the  staterun  hospital in ahmedabad over  hours they counted  body bags coming out of a single exit before they were loaded into waiting ambulances next day gujarat officially counted  deaths including  from ahmedabad again on the night of  april these journalists visited  cremation grounds around ahmedabad and counted more than  bodies with photographic and video evidence the next day ahmedabad counted only  deaths similar disparities in numbers were seen on other days the gujarat government denied the undercounting and stated that they were following federal protocolsa study conducted by the university of california berkeley and units of harvard university estimated in august  that more than  excess deaths had occurred in  municipalities in gujarat between march  and april  the study used data from civil death registers in a subset of gujarats  municipalities the authors stated that the vast majority of these deaths could likely be attributed directly to  the governments estimate of the death toll from  for the entire state was approximately  for the same period,2020-01-01
184,COVID-19 pandemic,January – present,2020,the – locust infestation is a pest outbreak of desert locusts which is threatening the food supply across the regions of east africa the arabian peninsula and the indian subcontinent the outbreak is the worst in  years in kenya and the worst in  years in ethiopia somalia and india the plague began in june  and continued into  although locust swarms have experienced steady declines in population and geographical reach from may to october and as of november  primarily found in the horn of africa and yementhe current outbreak began when cyclone mekunu in  produced heavy rains in the rub al khali of the arabian peninsula in spring  swarms spread from these areas and by june  the locusts spread north to iran pakistan and india and south to east africa particularly the horn of africa by the end of  there were swarms in ethiopia eritrea somalia kenya saudi arabia yemen egypt oman iran india and pakistan by june  a separate swarm appeared in south america affecting paraguay and argentinain april  travel and shipping restrictions precipitated by the spread of  began to hamper efforts to control the locusts preventing the transport of pesticides equipment and personnel and contributing to the global incidence of  related food insecuritylocust swarms worldwide faced a steady decline in size from may to october as countries and intergovernmental organisations have instituted extensive aerial and ground pest control efforts aided by low quantities of rainfall in several affected regions and the absence of storm activity in the indian ocean as of october  only ethiopia eritrea somalia and yemen harbour significant swarms of gregarious locusts with the remainder of the population situated in isolated pockets in kenya sudan and saudi arabia while locust swarms continue to threaten countries around the southern red sea and gulf of aden as well as their immediate neighbours they are not expected to return to countries east of the arabian peninsula nor to those west of sudanwhen periods of heavy rainfall follow periods of relative drought solitary desert locusts emerge to feed on newgrowth foliage and lay eggs in the newly moist soil which prevents them from drying out the sight and smell of other locusts as well as sensory stimulation from contact between locusts hind legs precipitates changes in the locusts behaviour and morphology the previously green nocturnal and solitary creatures become larger develop blackandyellow colouring and begin to seek out other locusts a process known as gregarization these changes result in the formation of large locust swarms that gregarize nearby locusts and breed profusely allowing them to undergo rapid exponential growth the swarms proceed to feed on the newly abundant vegetation making use of improved swarm coordination the result of larger brain sizes as well as increased range the result of increased metabolic activity larger muscles and longer wings to travel up to  km a day in search of new vegetation and moist weather often propelling themselves by the windthis particular desert locust plague traces back to may  when cyclone mekunu passed over a vast unpopulated desert on the southern arabian peninsula known as the rub al khali filling the space between sand dunes with ephemeral lakes which allowed locusts to breed undetected this was exacerbated in october  by cyclone luban which spawned in the central arabian sea moved westward and rained out over the same region near the border of yemen and oman the indian ocean dipole an irregular oscillation in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts of the indian ocean has increased in magnitude due to the effects of climate change  this shift has resulted in increased cyclone activity over the last decade in the persian gulf previously home to very few cyclones and is associated with flooding in countries along the western indian ocean dry weather in the east and bushfires in australiathe two cyclones created conditions conducive to mass locust reproduction enabling three generations of locusts to breed over a ninemonth period which increased their number in the arabian desert roughly  swarms have infested  countries as of april  east africa is the epicenter of the locust crisis—with ethiopia kenya somalia and uganda among the affected countries however the locusts have traveled far wiping out crops in pakistan and damaging farms in yemen a fragile country already hit hard by years of conflictby the summer of  swarms had reached over the red sea and the gulf of aden into ethiopia and somalia where they continued breeding and started causing concerns this might have been as far as the locusts got were it not for the fact that during october  east africa experienced unusually widespread and intense autumn rains which were capped in december by a rare late season cyclone pawan that made landfall in somalia these events triggered yet another spurt of reproductive activityin january  the outbreak was affecting ethiopia kenya eritrea djibouti somalia and burundi the infestation presents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods in the horn of africa according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao rising sea surface temperatures cf the indian ocean dipole tip the scales in favor of circulation patterns like the one that set the stage for the desert locust outbreak keith cressman senior locust forecasting officer with the food and agriculture organization said he thinks we can assume there will be more locust outbreaks and upsurges in the horn of africa” the situation was fueled by unusually heavy rains causing a big concern in the horn of africa where more than  million people are food insecure and  million people are internally displaced favourable conditions for the locusts prolonged the menace through january   december  several large immature swarms were first reported to have crossed into kenya from somalia entering through the towns of mandera and el wak heavy rains over the preceding short rain season october–december created an environment conducive to locust breeding and over the next two months the swarms spread and matured infesting  counties by the end of february and reaching kenyas borders with uganda and tanzania by then the plague was kenyas worst locust outbreak in over seventy years affecting approximately  hectares  acres of land and leading the countrys agriculture minister to state that authorities were unprepared for an infestation of such scale  over the next three months particularly favourable rains caused locust swarms to migrate to the northwestern counties of kenya and by midmay cumulative crop and pasture losses were estimated at between  percent in northern kenya and  percent in southeastern kenyahowever low levels of rainfall in may in conjunction with both new and continued ground and aerial pest control initiatives led to the locust population which had been stagnant over the preceding two months declining with reduced average swarm sizes and a less widespread distribution of locusts which were by then primarily resident in the northwestern counties of turkana and marsabit continued low rainfall and the relative lack of greenery in northwestern kenya resulted in a progressive decline in both swarm size and overall population from june to september resulting in reduced levels of locust maturation which placed much of the remaining locust population in recession as of october  a few small –  swarms slowly maturing at the border between the northwestern counties of baringo laikipia and samburu are the only remaining gregarious locust populations in the countrysomalia’s agriculture ministry called the outbreak a national emergency and major threat to the country’s fragile food security saying the “uncommonly large” locust swarms are consuming huge amounts of crops combating the crisis isnt likely to be easy especially in somalia where parts of the country are in the grip of the alqaidalinked alshabab extremist group desert locusts are breeding in the regions of galmudug mudug puntland and somaliland over the next six months projections indicate that more than   hectares of land will require direct control interventions in somaliain swarms the size of major cities the locusts also have affected various parts of eritrea the military and general public have been deployed to combat the crisis according to eritreas agricultural ministry in eritrea big swarms of immature adults that migrated from ethiopia were identified and controlled around shieb gahtielay wengebo and beareze of the northern red sea coast moreover the swarms of tree locust have been detected in tserona maiseraw quatit and digsa districts of southern eritreathe locusts also are heading towards ethiopia africas secondmost populous country in that nations worst outbreak in  years some residents were surprised to find the locusts inside their living roomsaccording to the agriculture ministry officials the relatively few locusts reaching ethiopias capital addis ababa are “leftovers” from the “massive invasion” in the eastern and southern parts of the country spraying is being conducted around the city to stop the outbreak from spreading elsewhere millions of people in this country already cope with the constant risk of drought or floodingthe desert locust infestation in ethiopia has deteriorated despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations hoppers have fledged and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in tigray amhara oromia and somali regional states in amhara some farms have registered nearly  percent loss of teff a staple crop in ethiopia moreover eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the somali region due to the heavy rainfalldespite major control and prevention operations substantial crop losses have already occurred in the amhara and tigray regions of ethiopia the hopper bands young locust populations moving together have covered nearly  square kilometres and have consumed about  million metric tonnes of vegetation over a twomonth period the formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the ethiopian somali region and massive new swarms will arrive from yemen and somalia a swarm even forced an ethiopian passenger plane off course in decemberfood ran out for the nearly  eritrean refugees in tigray which was partially caused by the tigran warthey are now heading toward uganda and fragile south sudan where almost half the country faces hunger as it emerges from civil war uganda has not had such an outbreak since the  and is already on alert uganda has not had to deal with a locust infestation since the ’ so there is concern about the ability for experts on the ground to be able to deal with it without external support this week uganda’s prime minister told agriculture authorities that “this is an emergency and all agencies must be on the alert” the governmentcontrolled new vision newspaper reportedthey are also now heading towards south sudan where almost half the country faces hunger as it emerges from civil war they have not had such an outbreak since the  and is already on alert in a country like south sudan where already  of the population is food insecure this crisis would cause devastating consequencesthe government of djibouti estimates that the damage caused by the desert locust infestations on vegetation cover crops and pastures have already caused a loss of around  million for the six regions of the country in djibouti it is estimated that over  agropastoral farms across the country and nearly  hectares of pastureland have been destroyed by the swarmsburundithe un food and agricultural organization fao and intergovernmental authority on development igad have both stated that the phenomenally heavy rains have contributed to not only the devastating  burundi landslides but also a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak the desert locust control organization for eastern africa the dlcoea which burundi is not member to noted the necessity for urgent and decisive action from all partners as well as the resources to support largescale ground surveys aerial spraying services provision of chemicals information dissemination and further capacity building for control operationscyclones in may and october  brought heavy rains that gave rise to favourable breeding conditions in the empty quarter of the southern arabian peninsula for at least nine months since june some countries like uae and iraq have seen small hopper groups but the situation is under control in these regionsin january  one of the first swarms reached yemen and it became one of the first breeding grounds for the desert locusts and caused them to spread morefrom january to june  the locusts started to enter saudi arabia they have so far tried a lot to control the locustsafter june  swarms invade the indopakistan border from iran and up to three generations occur due to longer than normal monsoon giving rise to large numbers of swarmssince june  the locust outbreak has been impacting eastern pakistan in november  karachi saw the first locust attack in the city since   january  the provincial khyber pakhtunkhwa government declared emergency in nine southern districts of the province to control the spread of locusts the emergency was declared in dera ismail khan tank lakki marwat bannu karak kohat hangu north and south waziristan districtson  february  the pakistani government declared a national emergency to protect crops and help farmersin iran as with the rest of the asian countries the locust started arriving in the first six months of  heavy rains in southwest iran exacerbated the situation the control operations have been less successful in yemen and iranthe swarms in india came from iran and pakistan but the situation has been brought under control with the help of pesticides and specialist equipment although extent of damage is to be assessed but theres no major loss a number of timely measures and a change in wind direction have prevented a spread and largescale damage to the rapeseed and cumin seed crops the officials said the outbreak began late  in gujarat and rajasthanthree villages in gujarats banaskantha district which shares a border with pakistans desert areas came under fresh locust attacks in january  in gujarat locust attacks in  damaged crops mainly rapeseed and cumin seed planted on about  hectares parts of western rajasthan have destroyed crops spread over at least  hectares of land the districts adversely affected by the large scale coordinated attacks by locusts include sri ganganagar jaisalmer barmer bikaner jodhpur churu and nagaur india has been able to bring swarms of desert locusts under control in two key oilseed producing statesin may amid the  pandemic parts of india such as rajasthan and madhya pradesh were severely affected by locust swarms measuring a kilometer wide the worst locust attack in  years on  june  millions of locusts swarmed on a massive scale in gurgaon delhincr region made look like a sand storm in the skyswarms of the locusts were reported to have entered nepal in late june  with damage to crops in parbat mahashilaon  june  a swarm reached argentina from paraguay reaching the corrientes province and by  june it was making its way into the entre ríos province destroying corn and cassava crops along the way and the brazilian state of rio grande do sularound  ha land has already been affected as of april  about  hectares  acres of land in kenya alone are already infested  million people facing severe acute food insecurity in ethiopia kenya somalia south sudan uganda and the united republic of tanzania if left unchecked the number of locusts could grow by  times by june  when drier weather will help bring the outbreak under control  million ha of land has been targeted for rapid locust surveillance and control in the eight east african countries   households have been targeted for rapid livelihoods protection in seven of the eight countries“effective control is estimated to be around  £ but if an upsurge occurs the cost will soar to ”wfp estimates that longterm response and recovery costs could top  if swarm growth is not controlled the world bank estimates that in africa alone more than  million hectares of cropland and pasture are at risk and damages and losses could amount to as much as  billion in coming yearsfao said containing the plague will cost at least  million so far donors have pledged  million as of april   of which has come from the bill and melinda gates foundation failure means more hunger in a region already battered by conflict and climate shocks aerial and ground spraying combined with constant tracking of the swarms are viewed as the most effective strategies but the travel restrictions during the  pandemic have hindered the preventive measuresin the winter breeding areas control operations started in december  in eritrea and to a lesser extent in sudan they extended to egypt and saudi arabia in january where they continued for several months before a further extension to spring breeding areas in saudi arabia february–june iran february–july and pakistan march–july control operations were then undertaken in the summer breeding areas along both sides of the indopakistan border may–february ethiopia august onwards and yemen july onwards during the winter of  control was carried out along both sides of the red sea november–march the horn of africa december–present and southern iran november onwards about  mha had been treated by february  of april  ethiopia was using five planes and kenya six planes for spraying and four planes for surveying but the kenyan government says it needs  planes for spraying  and a continuous supply of the pesticide fenitrothion kenya has trained more than  personnel from affected counties in monitoring of locust swarms to help prevent and control outbreaks authorities analyze satellite images stockpile pesticides and conduct aerial spraying the un has allocated  million for aerial sprayingat the intergovernmental authority on development climate prediction and applications centre based in nairobi researchers have been running a supercomputer model to predict breeding areas that may have been missed by ground monitoring these areas could become sources of new swarms if not sprayed and create an upsurge so if hoppers are stopped from adults this wouldnt lead to another cycle of infestation the supercomputer funded by £ of uk aid as part of its weather and climate information services for africa programme has successfully forecast the movement of locusts using data such as wind speed and direction temperature and humidity the model has achieved  accuracy in forecasting the future locations of the swarmsresearchers are now inputting data on soil moisture and vegetation cover to help predict where eggs have been laid and are likely to hatch and thrive this will then provide data on where african governments can direct their spraying efforts helping to control the hoppers before they swarm the kenyan government is on high alert and effective control measures have been put in placethe chinese government announced in february it was sending a team of experts to neighbouring pakistan to develop targeted programmes against the locusts and deploy  ducks,2020-01-01
185,Visakhapatnam gas leak,7 May,2020,the visakhapatnam gas leak also referred to as the vizag gas leak was an industrial accident that occurred at the lg polymers chemical plant in the r r venkatapuram village of the gopalapatnam neighbourhood located at the outskirts of visakhapatnam andhra pradesh india during the early morning of  may  the resulting vapour cloud spread over a radius of around   mi affecting the nearby areas and villages as per the national disaster response force ndrf the death toll was  and more than  people became sick after being exposed to the gaspreliminary investigations concluded that the accident was likely the result of insufficient maintenance of units storing the styrene monomer improper storage and operation errors the government of andhra pradesh announced an ex gratia of ₹ crore  or € for each family of the deceased as well as funds for the injured a budget of ₹ crore  million or € million was allocated for the compensation of all those affectedthe chemical plant of the r r venkatapuram village was originally established in  as hindustan polymers in  it was merged with mcdowell holdings a subsidiary of united breweries group in  it was acquired by the south korean company lg chem which renamed the company to lg polymers india lg chem expanded its operations at the lg polymers plant five times between  and  the plant manufactures polystyrene copolymer products and engineering plastic compoundsthe south korean parent company lg chem said in its may  affidavit a part of an application for environment clearance that the company did not have a legitimate environmental clearance issued by the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc after receiving an environmental impact assessment eia substantiating the produced quantity and for continuing operations according to the eia notification amendment of  under the environment protection act of  lg chemicals india which is part of the petrochemical industry falls into the category a and should get clearance from the moefcc every time they expanded their plant or brought a change to their manufactured product after november  lg chem expanded its operations at lg polymers plant five times between  and  without such clearance according to the may  affidavit since  it was instead operating with state permits required for starting a new business with renewals every five yearshowever lg chem spokesperson choi sangkyu told the associated press ap that the company had followed indian laws and operated based on the officials guidelines at the state and federal level he said that the affidavit was a pledge of compliance with the law rather than an admission of violating the law after the  notification choi said that the company consulted the ministry and was told that no clearance was required however environment secretary c k mishra told the ap that the plant would have no requirement of clearance in  but a clearance was imperative for any expansion or production change thereafterlg polymers had never asked for a federal clearance until  and as per the minutes of a meeting between the company and the andhra pradesh pollution control board the latter denied the formers request for producing engineering plastics at its plant however a member of the state pollution board said there was no information regarding any order by the state government to stop the plants operation in  the company applied for an environmental clearance for the first time to expand its manufacturing capacity of polystyrene a plastic used to make bottles and lids the environment ministry sent the application for a review citing that the company did not have a clearance for the chemicals it was already manufacturing the company withdrew the application while applying for a retroactive clearance that the ministry offered to companies in  as a onetime amnesty which remained pending until the fatal leak occurredaccording to the ap officials and legal experts like mahesh chandra mehta an environment lawyer indicated that the plant seemed to be operating in a legal grey area with the environmental clearance required under central regulations while the state executives are to look after the enforcement however to date there is no indication that the lack of environment clearance played a role in the disaster experts are also skeptical as the plant operated for years without any clearance mehta also pointed out that many such industries are operating without a clearance which shows how weak the environmental laws are in india that has to its credit several of the worlds most polluted cities mehta also said that each time the company renewed that permit the state pollution board which has the power to enforce federal environmental law would have been able to fine the company or deny a permit until it received federal clearance which it never did dr b sengupta environmental scientist and former head of central pollution control board cpcb said that the state permits only consider pollution and do not consider the site safety in contrast federal clearance assesses risks concerning the handling and storage of hazardous materials prevention of potential disasters and mitigation in cases of disasterthe plant was reopened on  may  following the nationwide lockdown implemented as a response to the  pandemic the plant stored  metric tons  long tons  short tons of styrene in tanks which were left unattended styrene monomer must be stored between – °c – °f because higher temperatures result in rapid vaporization it is believed that a computer glitch in the factorys cooling system allowed temperatures in the storage tanks to exceed safe levels causing the styrene to vaporize between  am and  am when maintenance activity was in progress the gas leaked from the plant and spread to nearby villagesthe fumes spread over a radius of   mi five villages r r venkatapuram padmapuram bc colony gopalapatnam and kamparapalem were the most affected areas hundreds of people were rushed to hospitals following widespread breathing difficulties and sensations of burning eyes many had been found lying on the ground unconscious as a result of gas exposure the initial estimate noted at least  deaths and – people in critical condition  by the next day the death toll had risen to thirteen more than  people were reportedly exposed to the gaslate at night on  may police ordered the evacuation of people in a  km  mi radius of the leak however police subsequently stated that this evacuation was precautionary and that there had not been a second leakexperts from the central government who inspected the plant said that it would have faced a catastrophe had the violation of safety norms at other storage facilities of the plant gone unnoticed for a few more days they said those facilities were vulnerable to a leak of vapour on a larger scale and stored in a highrisk condition an expert said polymerization was noticed in another storageaccording to deccan chronicle two experts from the national disaster management authority ndma dr anjan ray director of the indian institute of petroleum and shantanu geete an industry expert inspected the storage facilities of the plant as well as the vizag port dr ray an expert in styrene recommended that the government immediately remove the materials from the facility on  may  the andhra pradesh government directed the company to remove  metric tonnes mt of material out of the country with the ministry of shippings help the state government arranged two vessels to carry the load split into portions of  mt and  mt to the companys headquarter in seoulmekapati goutham reddy minister of industries of andhra pradesh said that the preliminary conclusion from the experts inspections was that the storage facilities were not designed to keep the material for a long duration however the plant personnel claimed that the material was

187,Cyclone Amphan,16 May,2020,super cyclonic storm amphan ˈɑːmpɑːn was a powerful and catastrophic tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in eastern india specifically in west bengal and odisha and in bangladesh in may  it was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the ganges delta since sidr of the  season and the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the bay of bengal since the  odisha cyclone it was also the fourth super cyclone that hit west bengal and kolkata since  after   and  as well as being one of the strongest storms to impact the area causing over  billion of damage amphan is also the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the north indian ocean surpassing the record held by cyclone nargis of  first tropical cyclone of the  north indian ocean cyclone season amphan originated from a lowpressure area persisting a couple hundred miles  km east of colombo sri lanka on  may  tracking northeastward the disturbance organized over exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures the joint typhoon warning center jtwc upgraded the system to a tropical depression on  may while the india meteorological department imd followed suit the following day on  may amphan underwent rapid intensification and became an extremely severe cyclonic storm within  hourson  may at approximately  utc amphan reached its peak intensity with  sustained wind speeds of  kmh  mph  sustained wind speeds of  kmh  mph and a minimum central barometric pressure of  mbar  inhg the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle shortly after it reached its peak intensity but the continued effects of dry air and wind shear disrupted this process and caused amphan to gradually weaken as it paralleled the eastern coastline of india on  may between  and  utc the cyclone made landfall in west bengal at the time the jtwc estimated amphans  sustained winds to be  kmh  mph amphan rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly thereaftercoastal areas in west bengal comprising east midnapore north  parganas south  parganas kolkata hooghly and howrah as well as odisha were affected by the cyclone it also caused significant destruction in bangladeshduring  may  an area of low pressure developed over the southeastern bay of bengal about  km  mi to the southeast of visakhapatnam in the indian state of andhra pradesh the area of low pressure was located within a favorable environment for further development with good equatorward outflow exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures between  and  °c recorded in the basin and low vertical wind shear over the next couple of days the system became more marked as it gradually consolidated further with bands of deep atmospheric convection wrapping into the systems lowlevel center during  may the india meteorological department imd reported that the area of low pressure had developed into a depression and designated it as bob  while it was located about  km  mi to the south of paradip in the indian state of odishamoving northwards the depression continually organised and became a cyclonic storm a few hours later receiving the name amphan intensification was temporarily impeded as moderate easterly wind shear disrupted the systems cloud pattern on  may conditions for significant intensification became more conducive as upperlevel winds improved as a result amphan underwent rapid intensification into a severe cyclonic storm with the jtwc assessing an increase in winds from  kmh  mph at  utc to  kmh  mph the equivalent to a category  hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale sshws just six hours later furthermore the imd upgraded amphan to an extremely severe cyclonic storm on their cyclone intensity scale the broad storm was characterized by a cloud shield extending more than  km  mi and a sharplyoutlined  nautical milewide eyeearly on  may microwave imagery depicted two distinct concentric eyewalls a telltale sign of an eyewall replacement cycle that is typical for very intense cyclones through the day the effects of wind shear and dry air hampered this internal core change causing the eyewall to erode by late on  may around  pm ist  utc amphan made landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm near bakkhali west bengal with winds of  kmh  mph as it moved further inland amphan rapidly weakened just six hours after landfall the jtwc downgraded the storm to a category  cyclone and issued its final warning on the system as it became disorganized on  may amphan degenerated into a wellmarked low pressure areaamphans forecast track placed  million people in india and bangladesh at risk of exposure to the storms winds according to the us pacific disaster center the formation of the precursor lowpressure system prompted the imd to issue a cyclonic alert for indias coastline

189,Assam gas and oil leak,27 May,2020,the  assam gas and oil leak also referred as the baghjan gas leak is a natural gas blowout that happened in oil india limiteds baghjan oilfield in tinsukia district assam india on  may  the blowout occurred at well no  in the baghjan oil field resulting in a leak of natural gas the leaking well subsequently caught fire on  june  and resulted in three deaths officially largescale local evacuations and environmental damage to the nearby dibrusaikhowa national park and magurimotapung wetlandthe blowout was killed on  november   days after the blowout with a technique called snubbing subsequently well no  was abandoned on  december  an investigation by a committee appointed by the national green tribunal revealed in november  that oil india limited had failed to obtain legally required clearances to operate the oil field at baghjan and had failed to comply with provisions of environmental laws as well as with internal safety procedures in relation to drilling at the oil field the findings reiterated a report by the assam state pollution control board which had also reported that oil india limited did not obtain the necessary clearances before drillingthe baghjan oil field is located in tinsukia district in the state of assam near baghjan village which has a resident population of  persons the nearest towns are doom dooma and tinsukiabaghjan oil field is located near the dibrusaikhowa national park in assam and is also in proximity to maguri motapung beel a natural wetland dibrusaikhowa national park is the only riverine island wildlife reserve globally it contains a variety of rare and endangered species including the gangetic dolphin which is endangered as well as herds of wild horses tigers capped langurs hoolock gibbons slow loris and several rare butterflies and fish the dibrusaikhowa national park is also connected to namdapha national park via the dehing patkai wildlife sanctuary these regions are part of the indoburma biodiversity hotspot baghjan well no  from which the leak occurred is located at a distance of  meters from the park and adjoins a buffer forested region surrounding the park it is also close to the indoburma biodiversity hotspoton  january  the central government exempted all oil and gas firms conducting exploratory drilling from legal requirements for environmental clearances prior to the leak in  the region witnessed protests after the government of india announced that they had authorized oil india limited oil to explore the area under dibrusaikhowa national park for hydrocarbonsduring may  prior to and during the leak tinsukia district in assam experienced heavy rains and flooding in two local rivers dibru and lohit the region was also placed in lockdown following the  pandemic in indiaa subsequent investigation by assams state pollution control board found that oil india limited had begun drilling at the baghjan oil field without obtaining prior environmental clearances in accordance with legal requirements under the water prevention of control of pollution act  air prevention of control of pollution act  and environment protection act  oil india limited had also failed to conduct mandatory public hearings before beginning drillingthe ecosensitive zone around dibrusaikhowa national park was reduced in size at the request of oil india limited in order to allow the well to be established in  the baghjan oil field was inspected by a team from the national board for wildlife which criticised the government of india for ratifying the breach of wildlife norms after oil india limited had already begun operating in an ecosensitive zonein  a blowout at an oil india limited well in dikom in assam resulted in the evacuation of  families the leak subsequently caught fire as wellon  february  near naharkatia in assam a stretch of the burhi dihing river which is a tributary to the brahmaputra river caught fire after a punctured pipeline carrying crude oil from the oil india limited headquarters at duliajan in assam leaked covering the water with a film of oil the fire burned for a period of  hours before the leak was repaired and it could be extinguished oil india limited officials stated that a technical error with their instruments had caused shut off valves in a storage tank to close resulting in pressure building up in a pipeline carrying crude oil this caused several leaks in the pipeline oil india limited officials blamed local residents for causing the fire and stated that a number of leaks had previously occurred as parts of attempts to steal quantities of crude oil from the delivery pipeline the central pollution control board had directed assams state pollution control board to investigate the damage to aquatic life and local environment caused by the leakthe baghjan oil field has  active wells of which  produce natural gas while the remaining produce oil baghjan oil fields well no  was established in  and produces natural gas it drills down to a depth of  meters and was producing between  to  standard cubic meters of gas per day before the leak drilling at the baghjan  well where the leak occurred was being outsourced to an ahmedabadbased firm john energy in may  a new reservoir was being tapped for additional production at a depth of  meters with workover operations taking place in addition the infrastructure for the previous reservoir was being serviced due to which production had been temporarily stopped a device for pressure control known as a blowout preventer had been temporarily uninstalled while the extraction assembly was being servicedin april  following a lockdown caused by the  pandemic in india oil india limited suspended drilling at several of the wells in the baghjan oil field primarily because of the unavailability of employeeson  may  before the leak the ministry of environment forest and climate change announced that they would be authorizing exploration for hydrocarbons under the dibrusaikhowa national park at seven different locations oil india limitedoil india limitedco stated that they would be using extended reach drilling erd to explore these wells without entering the national park itself baghjan oil well  at which the leak occurred will be one of the bases on which the erd will extend under the national parkon  may  at  am residents of baghjan village in assam reported hearing a loud sound from the nearby baghjan oil field reports of the sound of the explosion were also confirmed from residents of tinsukia town which is located at a distance of  kilometres from the oil field local newspaper the sentinel reported local accounts indicating that the gushing of natural gas from the well continued to produce an audible sound over the next few daysalthough production had been temporarily stopped at baghjans well no  to explore a new sand and to service the well workers noticed that gas was escaping from the capped well and had begun to evacuate the oil field before the incident at  am the blowout occurred resulted in the leak of natural gas from the well and causing a complete suspension in operations oil india limiteds official statement indicated that the well had suddenly became very active while workover operations were ongoingoil officials confirmed that the leak occurred from the existing sand which had been capped to allow exploration of the new sand this resulted in a fountain of crude oil from the sandthe leaked gas consisted of a naturally occurring mix of propane methane propylene and other gaseson  june  well no  caught fire after efforts to cap the leak were unsuccessful an official from oil india limited stated we cannot say how and why it happened in regard to the fire also noting that fires in the case of a blowout were not unexpected the fire occurred at the plinth of the well while cleaning operations were under way following the fire people who had not yet been evacuated from the local area left as the fire spread to local grasslands the fire quickly spread to a larger area and burned down nearby trees crops and houses  persons were injured and  houses destroyed in the resulting fire the tinsukia district collector stated that the condensate from the gas leak in surrounding areas had made the locale more vulnerable to fire and had allowed the fire to spread

the leak under control oil also sprayed the area with water on  may  four days after the initial leak a spokesperson from  oil india limited confirmed that the well control operation is yet to start  oil india limited officials also stated that the process of controlling the well would take time and that they were currently making arrangements to secure a water supply to help mitigate the leakin june  oil india limited officials stated that they had constructed a temporary reservoir of water in the vicinity of the well by placing pipes from the dangori river water from the reservoir would be used to spray on to the well area to protect workers while they attempted to place a blowout preventer using hydraulic devices followed by injecting mud to completely shut down production of gas or kill the well singaporebased alert disaster control experts were called in to assist with the processinitial efforts to control the leak were delayed because of severe flooding in assam which caused

204,Uttarakhand flood,7 February,2021,the  uttarakhand flood also known as the chamoli disaster began on  february  in the environs of the nanda devi national park a unesco world heritage site in the outer garhwal himalayas in uttarakhand state india maps  and  it was caused by a large rock and ice avalanche consisting of material dislodged from ronti peak it caused flooding in the chamoli district most notably in the rishiganga river the dhauliganga river and in turn the alaknanda—the major headstream of the ganges maps  and  the disaster left over  killed or missing most were workers at the tapovan dam siteaccording to early reports the flooding was speculated to have been caused by a portion of the nanda devi glacier breaking off early on  february releasing the water trapped behind the ice and causing a glacial lake outburst flood  but this was shown to be incorrect as satellite images showed no lakes in the valley and that a landslide very clearly triggered the events on  february  the times london reported that a flood was caused by a portion of glacier being torn away and causing a landslide  in satellite images a  mi  km scar is visible on the slopes of nanda ghunti a  ft  m peak on the southwestern rim of the nanda devi sanctuary a wall of mountains surrounding the nanda devi massif maps   and  according to an article in scientific american  february  data from planet labs was interpreted by dan shugar a geomorphologist at the university of calgary to suggest that a hanging glacier  football fields long and five across had separated from a mountain and plummeted into the ronti gad a tributary of the rishiganga map  °  n °  e map  lowest leftbank tributaryaccording to bbc news four scientists from the wadia institute of himalayan geology dehradun india flew over the site in a helicopter took photographs and gathered other data they consider the hanging glacier that cracked and plunged into the rishiganga basin  to have been attached to a subsidiary peak raunthi   just below nanda ghunti map  ronti at the intersection of  and  according to dr kalachand sain director of the wadia institute climate change is the major factor in the rapid freezing and thawing of ice that causes glacier fractures a subsequent analysis by carbon brief highlighted how though climate change probably didnt directly cause the outburst  instead a landslide or similar geological change triggered it however the environmental changes caused by climate change probably contributed to the geographic conditions that allowed for the disasterin june  the international charter space and major disasters published a study that confirmed a large rock and ice avalanche as the cause of the disaster the result was based on data from earth observation satellites as well as seismic records numerical model results and eyewitness videos the authors estimate the avalanche at about  million cubic meters consisting of  rock and  glacier ice the glacier ice turned into water over the course of the  elevation difference from the peak which further worsened the impact by causing a debris flood waveamong the places most severely hit by the floods are

of the area prior to the disaster has been described as fragile according to the new york times scientists had warned the government of india for many years that the himalayas had been warming at a dangerously high rate and the regions ecosystem had become too physically exposed to the dangers of development projects  dr ravi chopra the director of the peoples science institute in uttarakhand and a member of a scientific committee appointed by indias supreme court in  had advised against building dams in the paraglacial zone ie river valleys in which the floor is higher than  feet but the government of india disregarded their objections  according to dr chopra both the hydroelectric power projects that were washed away in the flood were constructed in this zone  according to another committee led by dr chopra and appointed by indias supreme court in  per the new york times the government of india had built  miles of highway—much  feet wide—in the hills of uttarakhand in order to improve approaches to hindu temples in the high himalayas overriding the advice of its own experts  the headman of reni the village most adversely affected by the flood stated that the village residents feared that the blasting of the rocks during the hydropower dams construction would bring on dangerous landslides  “we used to hear blasting and see the rocks shift” he said “when this

cyclonic storm first severe cyclonic storm first very severe cyclonic storm and first extremely severe cyclonic storm of the  north indian ocean cyclone season tauktae originated from a tropical disturbance which was first monitored by the india meteorological department on may  the disturbance drifted eastward and organized into a deep depression by may  the storm soon took a northward turn continuing to gradually intensify and the system strengthened into a cyclonic storm and was named tauktae later that same day tauktae continued intensifying into may  reaching severe cyclonic storm status later that day tauktae began to parallel the coast of the indian states of kerala karnataka goa and maharashtra before rapidly intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm early on may  early on may  tauktae intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm reaching its peak intensity soon afterward later that same day tauktae underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and weakened before restrengthening as it neared the coast of gujarat making landfall soon afterwardafter making landfall tauktae gradually weakened as it turned northeastward moving further inland on may  tauktae weakened into a wellmarked lowpressure areatauktae brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to areas along the coast of kerala and on lakshadweep there were reports of heavy rain in the states of goa karnataka and maharashtra as well tauktae resulted in at least  deaths in india and left another  people missing there were also  deaths reported in pakistan the storm displaced over  people in

organized amid favorable conditions including sea surface temperatures of up to  °c  degrees fahrenheit and low wind shear the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on this system on may  a few hours later the jtwc designated it as tropical cyclone  the system gradually intensified as the previously disorganized broad area of convection began to wrap around the lowlevel circulation center it further strengthened to become a deep depression at  utc the next day around this time the system turned northeastwards and began to move towards india due to the very large area of convection over the cyclone it dumped heavy rainfall over the southern portions of the country six hours after the upgrade the system became even more organized and intensified into a cyclonic storm receiving the name tauktae by the imd tauktae later intensified into a severe cyclonic storm at  utc on may  as a robust central dense overcast developed just three hours later the jtwc upgraded

central dense overcast cdo region at  pm local time ist the cyclone made landfall near una in gujarat soon afterward the jtwc issued their final warning on the system in the advisory the agency estimated tauktaes  sustained winds at landfall to be  mph  kilometres per hour making tauktae the equivalent of a highend category  tropical cyclone making it the strongest storm to make landfall in gujarat since reliable records began surpassing the record set by  gujarat cyclone afterward due to land interaction the storm began to weaken slowly the brown ocean effect from the gulf of kutch and gulf of khambhat caused the storm to weaken at a slower pace than usual by  am local time ist the storm had weakened below severe cyclonic storm intensity before weakening below cyclonic storm
